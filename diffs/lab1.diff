+# Nachos-project
+Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System
+
+This is our course-work for the OS course in HCMUS.
+
+Nashos version: 4.0
+
+## Installation
+
+To install: run `bash full_install.sh`. In case of error, you might want to run the installation step by step via:
+```bash
+# Install building tools like make, g++
+bash install_building_tools.sh
+
+# Build the nachos
+bash build_nachos.sh
+
+# Build the coff2noff translator
+bash coff2noff.sh
+
+# Build & run tests in code/test folder
+bash build_test.sh
+```
+
+You can read the full building instruction [here](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~ntquan/os/setup_nachos.html) if you want to (believe me, you don't want to read it :) ).
+
+
+## CI/CD
+
+I've set up the GitHub workflow, it will automatically build & test the nachos when you make a commit.
+
+Please make sure that you passed all the workflows before creating a pull request.

+# All rights reserved.  See copyright.h for copyright notice and limitation 
+# of liability and disclaimer of warranty provisions.
+#
+# This is a GNU Makefile.  It must be used with the GNU make program.
+# At UW, the GNU make program is /software/gnu/bin/make.
+# In many other places it is known as "gmake".
+# You may wish to include /software/gnu/bin/ early in your command
+# search path, so that you will be using GNU make when you type "make".
+#
+# About this Makefile:
+# --------------------
+#
+#  This Makefile is used to build the Nachos system, which includes
+#   the MIPS machine simulation and a simple operating system.
+#
+#  There is a separate Makefile, in the "test" directory, that is
+#   used to build the Nachos test programs (which run on the
+#   simulated machine).
+#
+#  There are several "build" directories, one for each type
+#   of machine in the MFCF computing environment
+#   (build.solaris, build.sunos, and build.ultrix), as well
+#   as a build directory for Linux (build.linux) and a generic
+#   build directory (build.other) for those who wish to try
+#   building Nachos on other platforms.
+#
+#  This Makefile appears to be located in all of the build directories.
+#  If you edit it in one directory, the copies in all of the other
+#  directories appear to change as well.  This is the desired behaviour,
+#  since this file is machine independent.  (The file actually lives
+#  in build.solaris, with symbolic links from the other build directories.)
+#
+#  The platform-dependent parts of make's instructions are located
+#  in the file Makefile.dep.
+#  There is a different Makefile.dep in each build directory.
+#
+#  If you are in the MFCF environment, you should not have to edit
+#  the Makefile.dep files by hand.  Any changes to the make instructions
+#  can be made in this file (see the instructions below) - they will
+#  apply no matter where you build Nachos.
+#  If you are not in the MFCF environment, e.g., if you are trying
+#  to build Nachos on Linux at home, you will probably need
+#  to edit Makefile.dep (in the appropriate build directory) to
+#  customize the make procedure to your environment.
+#
+# How to build Nachos for the first time:
+# ---------------------------------------
+#
+#   (1) Make sure than you are in the build directory for the
+#	type of machine you are logged in to (the "host" machine):
+#
+#	host type	examples		build directory
+# 	-----------	-----------		----------------
+#
+#	sparc/SunOS	cayley,napier,		build.sunos
+#	(SunOS 4.1.3)	descartes
+#
+#	sparc/Solaris	picard.math,		build.solaris
+#	(SunOS 5.x)	hermite.math,
+#			markov.math,
+#			hypatia.math,
+#			hume.math
+#
+#	mips/ULTRIX	cantor.math		build.ultrix
+#	(ULTRIX 4.2)	noether.math
+#
+#	If you are not sure what type of machine you are on,
+#	try the command "uname -a".  
+#
+#   (2) Type "make depend"
+#		- this computes file dependencies and records them
+#			at the end of the file Makefile.dep in 
+#			your build directory.  Have a look...
+#
+#   (3) Type "make nachos"  (or just "make").
+#               - make echos the commands it is executing, so that
+#			you can observe its progress.  When the
+#			build is finished, you should have an
+#			executable "nachos" in the build directory.
+#
+#   (4) There is no 4th step.  You are done.  Try running "./nachos -u".
+#
+#
+# How to Re-build Nachos after you have changed the code:
+#--------------------------------------------------------
+#
+#     - The Nachos source code is located in the code subdirectories:
+#	  threads, userprog, filesys, network, and lib.  You may
+#         change the files in any of these directories, and you can
+#         add new files and/or remove files. The "machine" subdirectory
+#	  contains the hardware simulation (which is also part of
+#	  Nachos.  You may look at it, but
+#	  you may not change it, except as noted in machine/machine.h
+#     - When you want to re-make Nachos, always do it in the
+#	  "build" directory that is appropriate for the machine
+#	  type that you are running on.  
+#	DO NOT TRY TO MAKE NACHOS IN THE SOURCE CODE DIRECTORIES.
+#
+#     - IF all you have done is changed C++ code in existing files
+#	(since the last time you made Nachos in this build directory),
+#	THEN all you need to do to re-make Nachos is to type
+#
+#		"make nachos"
+#
+#	in the build directory.
+#
+#     - IF you have done any of the following since the last build in
+#	  this directory:
+#		added new .cc files or new .h files
+#		added or deleted #include's from existing files
+#	THEN
+#		you must do
+#		"make depend"
+#		followed by
+#		"make nachos"
+#
+#	in the build directory.
+#
+#       Note that is is always safe to do "make depend" followed by
+# 	"make nachos", so if you are not sure what changes you have
+#	made, do "make depend".
+#
+#     - IF you have added new files (.cc or .h) since the last build,
+#	you should edit this Makefile before running "make depend"
+# 	and "make nachos".
+
+#	For new .h files, simply update the appropriate "_H" list below.
+#       For example, if you create a file called
+#       "bigfile.h" in the filesys subdirectory, you should add
+#       "../filesys/bigfile.h" to FILESYS_H, which is defined below
+
+#	For new .cc files, update the appropriate "_C" and "_O" lists.
+#       For example, if you create a file called "filetable.cc" in
+#	the directory "userprog", you should add
+#	"../userprog/filetable.cc" to USERPROG_C,
+#       and you should add "filetable.o" to USERPROG_O.
+#       Note that the entry in the "_C" list includes the subdirectory
+#	name, while the entry on the "_O" list does not.
+#
+#  Some Important Notes:
+#  ---------------------
+#
+#       *  You can clean up all of the .o and other files left behind
+#	   by make by typeing "make clean" in the build directory.
+#	*  You can clean up .o and other files, as well as the nachos
+#	   executable, DISK, core, SOCKET, and other files by typing
+#	   make "distclean"
+#
+#	These are good ways to save space, but the next build that
+#	you do after cleaning will take longer than usual, since
+#	much of the stuff you cleaned will need to be rebuilt.
+#
+#       *  When you build Nachos on an ULTRIX machine (in build.ultrix),
+#	   you will get lots of warning messages like this:
+#
+#	openfile.o: does not have gp tables for all it's sectons
+#
+#	   from the loader.  Ignore them.  Or better yet, figure out
+#	   how to make them go away.
+#
+#  The Most Important Note:
+#  -----------------------
+#
+#	* If "make" is behaving strangely and you cannot figure out
+#	why, you should REBUILD the program FROM SCRATCH.
+#	Yes, it is slow.
+#	But, there are lots of little things that can go wrong, especially
+#	with all of these different types of machines available.
+#	Rebuilding from scratch at least gives you a known starting
+#	place.  To rebuild from scratch, go to the appropriate
+#	build directory and do:
+#	
+#		make distclean
+#		make depend
+#		make nachos

+#
+# This is a GNU Makefile.  It must be used with the GNU make program.
+# At UW, the GNU make program is /software/gnu/bin/make.
+# In many other places it is known as "gmake".
+# You may wish to include /software/gnu/bin/ early in your command
+# search path, so that you will be using GNU make when you type "make".
+#
+# About this Makefile:
+# --------------------
+#
+#  This Makefile is used to build the Nachos system, which includes
+#   the MIPS machine simulation and a simple operating system.
+#
+#  There is a separate Makefile, in the "test" directory, that is
+#   used to build the Nachos test programs (which run on the
+#   simulated machine).
+#
+#  There are several "build" directories, one for each type
+#   of machine in the MFCF computing environment
+#   (build.solaris, build.sunos, and build.ultrix), as well
+#   as a build directory for Linux (build.linux) and a generic
+#   build directory (build.other) for those who wish to try
+#   building Nachos on other platforms.
+#
+#  This Makefile appears to be located in all of the build directories.
+#  If you edit it in one directory, the copies in all of the other
+#  directories appear to change as well.  This is the desired behaviour,
+#  since this file is machine independent.  (The file actually lives
+#  in build.solaris, with symbolic links from the other build directories.)
+#
+#  The platform-dependent parts of make's instructions are located
+#  in the file Makefile.dep.
+#  There is a different Makefile.dep in each build directory.
+#
+#  If you are in the MFCF environment, you should not have to edit
+#  the Makefile.dep files by hand.  Any changes to the make instructions
+#  can be made in this file (see the instructions below) - they will
+#  apply no matter where you build Nachos.
+#  If you are not in the MFCF environment, e.g., if you are trying
+#  to build Nachos on Linux at home, you will probably need
+#  to edit Makefile.dep (in the appropriate build directory) to
+#  customize the make procedure to your environment.
+#
+# How to build Nachos for the first time:
+# ---------------------------------------
+#
+#   (1) Make sure than you are in the build directory for the
+#	type of machine you are logged in to (the "host" machine):
+#
+#	host type	examples		build directory
+# 	-----------	-----------		----------------
+#
+#	sparc/SunOS	cayley,napier,		build.sunos
+#	(SunOS 4.1.3)	descartes
+#
+#	sparc/Solaris	picard.math,		build.solaris
+#	(SunOS 5.x)	hermite.math,
+#			markov.math,
+#			hypatia.math,
+#			hume.math
+#
+#	mips/ULTRIX	cantor.math		build.ultrix
+#	(ULTRIX 4.2)	noether.math
+#
+#	If you are not sure what type of machine you are on,
+#	try the command "uname -a".  
+#
+#   (2) Type "make depend"
+#		- this computes file dependencies and records them
+#			at the end of the file Makefile.dep in 
+#			your build directory.  Have a look...
+#
+#   (3) Type "make nachos"  (or just "make").
+#               - make echos the commands it is executing, so that
+#			you can observe its progress.  When the
+#			build is finished, you should have an
+#			executable "nachos" in the build directory.
+#
+#   (4) There is no 4th step.  You are done.  Try running "./nachos -u".
+#
+#
+# How to Re-build Nachos after you have changed the code:
+#--------------------------------------------------------
+#
+#     - The Nachos source code is located in the code subdirectories:
+#	  threads, userprog, filesys, network, and lib.  You may
+#         change the files in any of these directories, and you can
+#         add new files and/or remove files. The "machine" subdirectory
+#	  contains the hardware simulation (which is also part of
+#	  Nachos.  You may look at it, but
+#	  you may not change it, except as noted in machine/machine.h
+#     - When you want to re-make Nachos, always do it in the
+#	  "build" directory that is appropriate for the machine
+#	  type that you are running on.  
+#	DO NOT TRY TO MAKE NACHOS IN THE SOURCE CODE DIRECTORIES.
+#
+#     - IF all you have done is changed C++ code in existing files
+#	(since the last time you made Nachos in this build directory),
+#	THEN all you need to do to re-make Nachos is to type
+#
+#		"make nachos"
+#
+#	in the build directory.
+#
+#     - IF you have done any of the following since the last build in
+#	  this directory:
+#		added new .cc files or new .h files
+#		added or deleted #include's from existing files
+#	THEN
+#		you must do
+#		"make depend"
+#		followed by
+#		"make nachos"
+#
+#	in the build directory.
+#
+#       Note that is is always safe to do "make depend" followed by
+# 	"make nachos", so if you are not sure what changes you have
+#	made, do "make depend".
+#
+#     - IF you have added new files (.cc or .h) since the last build,
+#	you should edit this Makefile before running "make depend"
+# 	and "make nachos".
+
+#	For new .h files, simply update the appropriate "_H" list below.
+#       For example, if you create a file called
+#       "bigfile.h" in the filesys subdirectory, you should add
+#       "../filesys/bigfile.h" to FILESYS_H, which is defined below
+
+#	For new .cc files, update the appropriate "_C" and "_O" lists.
+#       For example, if you create a file called "filetable.cc" in
+#	the directory "userprog", you should add
+#	"../userprog/filetable.cc" to USERPROG_C,
+#       and you should add "filetable.o" to USERPROG_O.
+#       Note that the entry in the "_C" list includes the subdirectory
+#	name, while the entry on the "_O" list does not.
+#
+#  Some Important Notes:
+#  ---------------------
+#
+#       *  You can clean up all of the .o and other files left behind
+#	   by make by typeing "make clean" in the build directory.
+#	*  You can clean up .o and other files, as well as the nachos
+#	   executable, DISK, core, SOCKET, and other files by typing
+#	   make "distclean"
+#
+#	These are good ways to save space, but the next build that
+#	you do after cleaning will take longer than usual, since
+#	much of the stuff you cleaned will need to be rebuilt.
+#
+#       *  When you build Nachos on an ULTRIX machine (in build.ultrix),
+#	   you will get lots of warning messages like this:
+#
+#	openfile.o: does not have gp tables for all it's sectons
+#
+#	   from the loader.  Ignore them.  Or better yet, figure out
+#	   how to make them go away.
+#
+#  The Most Important Note:
+#  -----------------------
+#
+#	* If "make" is behaving strangely and you cannot figure out
+#	why, you should REBUILD the program FROM SCRATCH.
+#	Yes, it is slow.
+#	But, there are lots of little things that can go wrong, especially
+#	with all of these different types of machines available.
+#	Rebuilding from scratch at least gives you a known starting
+#	place.  To rebuild from scratch, go to the appropriate
+#	build directory and do:
+#	
+#		make distclean
+#		make depend
+#		make nachos

+#
+# This is a GNU Makefile.  It must be used with the GNU make program.
+# At UW, the GNU make program is /software/gnu/bin/make.
+# In many other places it is known as "gmake".
+# You may wish to include /software/gnu/bin/ early in your command
+# search path, so that you will be using GNU make when you type "make".
+#
+# About this Makefile:
+# --------------------
+#
+#  This Makefile is used to build the Nachos system, which includes
+#   the MIPS machine simulation and a simple operating system.
+#
+#  There is a separate Makefile, in the "test" directory, that is
+#   used to build the Nachos test programs (which run on the
+#   simulated machine).
+#
+#  There are several "build" directories, one for each type
+#   of machine in the MFCF computing environment
+#   (build.solaris, build.sunos, and build.ultrix), as well
+#   as a build directory for Linux (build.linux) and a generic
+#   build directory (build.other) for those who wish to try
+#   building Nachos on other platforms.
+#
+#  This Makefile appears to be located in all of the build directories.
+#  If you edit it in one directory, the copies in all of the other
+#  directories appear to change as well.  This is the desired behaviour,
+#  since this file is machine independent.  (The file actually lives
+#  in build.solaris, with symbolic links from the other build directories.)
+#
+#  The platform-dependent parts of make's instructions are located
+#  in the file Makefile.dep.
+#  There is a different Makefile.dep in each build directory.
+#
+#  If you are in the MFCF environment, you should not have to edit
+#  the Makefile.dep files by hand.  Any changes to the make instructions
+#  can be made in this file (see the instructions below) - they will
+#  apply no matter where you build Nachos.
+#  If you are not in the MFCF environment, e.g., if you are trying
+#  to build Nachos on Linux at home, you will probably need
+#  to edit Makefile.dep (in the appropriate build directory) to
+#  customize the make procedure to your environment.
+#
+# How to build Nachos for the first time:
+# ---------------------------------------
+#
+#   (1) Make sure than you are in the build directory for the
+#	type of machine you are logged in to (the "host" machine):
+#
+#	host type	examples		build directory
+# 	-----------	-----------		----------------
+#
+#	sparc/SunOS	cayley,napier,		build.sunos
+#	(SunOS 4.1.3)	descartes
+#
+#	sparc/Solaris	picard.math,		build.solaris
+#	(SunOS 5.x)	hermite.math,
+#			markov.math,
+#			hypatia.math,
+#			hume.math
+#
+#	mips/ULTRIX	cantor.math		build.ultrix
+#	(ULTRIX 4.2)	noether.math
+#
+#	If you are not sure what type of machine you are on,
+#	try the command "uname -a".  
+#
+#   (2) Type "make depend"
+#		- this computes file dependencies and records them
+#			at the end of the file Makefile.dep in 
+#			your build directory.  Have a look...
+#
+#   (3) Type "make nachos"  (or just "make").
+#               - make echos the commands it is executing, so that
+#			you can observe its progress.  When the
+#			build is finished, you should have an
+#			executable "nachos" in the build directory.
+#
+#   (4) There is no 4th step.  You are done.  Try running "./nachos -u".
+#
+#
+# How to Re-build Nachos after you have changed the code:
+#--------------------------------------------------------
+#
+#     - The Nachos source code is located in the code subdirectories:
+#	  threads, userprog, filesys, network, and lib.  You may
+#         change the files in any of these directories, and you can
+#         add new files and/or remove files. The "machine" subdirectory
+#	  contains the hardware simulation (which is also part of
+#	  Nachos.  You may look at it, but
+#	  you may not change it, except as noted in machine/machine.h
+#     - When you want to re-make Nachos, always do it in the
+#	  "build" directory that is appropriate for the machine
+#	  type that you are running on.  
+#	DO NOT TRY TO MAKE NACHOS IN THE SOURCE CODE DIRECTORIES.
+#
+#     - IF all you have done is changed C++ code in existing files
+#	(since the last time you made Nachos in this build directory),
+#	THEN all you need to do to re-make Nachos is to type
+#
+#		"make nachos"
+#
+#	in the build directory.
+#
+#     - IF you have done any of the following since the last build in
+#	  this directory:
+#		added new .cc files or new .h files
+#		added or deleted #include's from existing files
+#	THEN
+#		you must do
+#		"make depend"
+#		followed by
+#		"make nachos"
+#
+#	in the build directory.
+#
+#       Note that is is always safe to do "make depend" followed by
+# 	"make nachos", so if you are not sure what changes you have
+#	made, do "make depend".
+#
+#     - IF you have added new files (.cc or .h) since the last build,
+#	you should edit this Makefile before running "make depend"
+# 	and "make nachos".
+
+#	For new .h files, simply update the appropriate "_H" list below.
+#       For example, if you create a file called
+#       "bigfile.h" in the filesys subdirectory, you should add
+#       "../filesys/bigfile.h" to FILESYS_H, which is defined below
+
+#	For new .cc files, update the appropriate "_C" and "_O" lists.
+#       For example, if you create a file called "filetable.cc" in
+#	the directory "userprog", you should add
+#	"../userprog/filetable.cc" to USERPROG_C,
+#       and you should add "filetable.o" to USERPROG_O.
+#       Note that the entry in the "_C" list includes the subdirectory
+#	name, while the entry on the "_O" list does not.
+#
+#  Some Important Notes:
+#  ---------------------
+#
+#       *  You can clean up all of the .o and other files left behind
+#	   by make by typeing "make clean" in the build directory.
+#	*  You can clean up .o and other files, as well as the nachos
+#	   executable, DISK, core, SOCKET, and other files by typing
+#	   make "distclean"
+#
+#	These are good ways to save space, but the next build that
+#	you do after cleaning will take longer than usual, since
+#	much of the stuff you cleaned will need to be rebuilt.
+#
+#       *  When you build Nachos on an ULTRIX machine (in build.ultrix),
+#	   you will get lots of warning messages like this:
+#
+#	openfile.o: does not have gp tables for all it's sectons
+#
+#	   from the loader.  Ignore them.  Or better yet, figure out
+#	   how to make them go away.
+#
+#  The Most Important Note:
+#  -----------------------
+#
+#	* If "make" is behaving strangely and you cannot figure out
+#	why, you should REBUILD the program FROM SCRATCH.
+#	Yes, it is slow.
+#	But, there are lots of little things that can go wrong, especially
+#	with all of these different types of machines available.
+#	Rebuilding from scratch at least gives you a known starting
+#	place.  To rebuild from scratch, go to the appropriate
+#	build directory and do:
+#	
+#		make distclean
+#		make depend
+#		make nachos

+//	Routines to manage a directory of file names.
+//
+//	The directory is a table of fixed length entries; each
+//	entry represents a single file, and contains the file name,
+//	and the location of the file header on disk.  The fixed size
+//	of each directory entry means that we have the restriction
+//	of a fixed maximum size for file names.
+//
+//	The constructor initializes an empty directory of a certain size;
+//	we use ReadFrom/WriteBack to fetch the contents of the directory
+//	from disk, and to write back any modifications back to disk.
+//
+//	Also, this implementation has the restriction that the size
+//	of the directory cannot expand.  In other words, once all the
+//	entries in the directory are used, no more files can be created.

+//
+//      Both the bitmap and the directory are represented as normal

+//	(sector 0 and sector 1), so that the file system can find them
+//	on bootup.
+//
+//	The file system assumes that the bitmap and directory files are
+//	kept "open" continuously while Nachos is running.
+//
+//	For those operations (such as Create, Remove) that modify the
+//	directory and/or bitmap, if the operation succeeds, the changes
+//	are written immediately back to disk (the two files are kept
+//	open during all this time).  If the operation fails, and we have
+//	modified part of the directory and/or bitmap, we simply discard
+//	the changed version, without writing it back to disk.
+//
+// 	Our implementation at this point has the following restrictions:
+//
+//	   there is no synchronization for concurrent accesses
+//	   files have a fixed size, set when the file is created
+//	   files cannot be bigger than about 3KB in size
+//	   there is no hierarchical directory structure, and only a limited
+//	     number of files can be added to the system
+//	   there is no attempt to make the system robust to failures

+// filesys.h
+//	Data structures to represent the Nachos file system.
+//
+//	A file system is a set of files stored on disk, organized
+//	into directories.  Operations on the file system have to
+//	do with "naming" -- creating, opening, and deleting files,
+//	given a textual file name.  Operations on an individual
+//	"open" file (read, write, close) are to be found in the OpenFile
+//	class (openfile.h).
+//
+//	We define two separate implementations of the file system.
+//	The "STUB" version just re-defines the Nachos file system
+//	operations as operations on the native UNIX file system on the machine
+//	running the Nachos simulation.
+//
+//	The other version is a "real" file system, built on top of
+//	a disk simulator.  The disk is simulated using the native UNIX
+//	file system (in a file named "DISK").
+//
+//	In the "real" implementation, there are two key data structures used
+//	in the file system.  There is a single "root" directory, listing
+//	all of the files in the file system; unlike UNIX, the baseline
+//	system does not provide a hierarchical directory structure.
+//	In addition, there is a bitmap for allocating
+//	disk sectors.  Both the root directory and the bitmap are themselves
+//	stored as files in the Nachos file system -- this causes an interesting
+//	bootstrap problem when the simulated disk is initialized.

+//	guarantee that it will work in general.  In particular, it
+//	assumes that the "==" operator works for both keys and values.
+//
+//	In addition, the key must have Hash() defined:
+//		unsigned Hash(Key k);
+//			returns a randomized # based on value of key
+//
+//	The value must have a function defined to retrieve the key:
+//		Key GetKey(T x);
+//
+//	The hash table automatically resizes itself as items are
+//	put into the table.  The implementation uses chaining

+// sysdep.cc
+//	Implementation of system-dependent interface.  Nachos uses the
+//	routines defined here, rather than directly calling the UNIX library,
+//	to simplify porting between versions of UNIX, and even to
+//	other systems, such as MSDOS.
+//
+//	On UNIX, almost all of these routines are simple wrappers
+//	for the underlying UNIX system calls.
+//
+//	NOTE: all of these routines refer to operations on the underlying
+//	host machine (e.g., the DECstation, SPARC, etc.), supporting the
+//	Nachos simulation code.  Nachos implements similar operations,
+//	(such as opening a file), but those are implemented in terms
+//	of hardware devices, which are simulated by calls to the underlying
+//	routines in the host workstation OS.
+//
+//	This file includes lots of calls to C routines.  C++ requires
+//	us to wrap all C definitions with a "extern "C" block".
+// 	This prevents the internal forms of the names from being
+// 	changed by the C++ compiler.

+// has a single surface, split up into "tracks", and each track split
+// up into "sectors" (the same number of sectors on each track, and each
+// sector has the same number of bytes of storage).
+//
+// Addressing is by sector number -- each sector on the disk is given
+// a unique number: track * SectorsPerTrack + offset within a track.
+//
+// As with other I/O devices, the raw physical disk is an asynchronous device --

+//
+// The physical disk is in fact simulated via operations on a UNIX file.
+//
+// To make life a little more realistic, the simulated time for
+// each operation reflects a "track buffer" -- RAM to store the contents
+// of the current track as the disk head passes by.  The idea is that the

+//	Routines to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses.
+//	Software sets up a table of legal translations.  We look up
+//	in the table on every memory reference to find the true physical
+//	memory location.
+//
+// Two types of translation are supported here.
+//
+//	Linear page table -- the virtual page # is used as an index
+//	into the table, to find the physical page #.
+//
+//	Translation lookaside buffer -- associative lookup in the table
+//	to find an entry with the same virtual page #.  If found,
+//	this entry is used for the translation.
+//	If not, it traps to software with an exception.
+//
+//	In practice, the TLB is much smaller than the amount of physical
+//	memory (16 entries is common on a machine that has 1000's of
+//	pages).  Thus, there must also be a backup translation scheme
+//	(such as page tables), but the hardware doesn't need to know
+//	anything at all about that.
+//
+//	Note that the contents of the TLB are specific to an address space.
+//	If the address space changes, so does the contents of the TLB!

+// 	The US Post Office (and Canada Post! -KMS)
+//      delivers mail to the addressed mailbox.
+// 	By analogy, our post office delivers packets to a specific buffer
+// 	(MailBox), based on the mailbox number stored in the packet header.
+// 	Mail waits in the box until a thread asks for it; if the mailbox
+//      is empty, threads can wait for mail to arrive in it.
+//
+// 	Thus, the service our post office provides is to de-multiplex
+// 	incoming packets, delivering them to the appropriate thread.
+//
+//      With each message, you get a return address, which consists of a "from
+// 	address", which is the id of the machine that sent the message, and
+// 	a "from box", which is the number of a mailbox on the sending machine
+//	to which you can send an acknowledgement, if your protocol requires

+# Makefile for building user programs to run on top of Nachos
+#
+#  Use "make" to build the test executable(s)
+#  Use "make clean" to remove .o files and .coff files
+#  Use "make distclean" to remove all files produced by make, including
+#     the test executables
+#
+# This is a GNU Makefile.  It must be used with the GNU make program.
+# At UW, the GNU make program is /software/gnu/bin/make.
+# In many other places it is known as "gmake".
+# You may wish to include /software/gnu/bin/ early in your command
+# search path, so that you will be using GNU make when you type "make".
+#
+# Several things to be aware of:
+#
+#    It should not be necessary to build the test executables for
+#     every type of host machine on which Nachos runs.  You should
+#     be able to build them once, and then use them regardless of
+#     the host machine type.  That is because the test executables
+#     run on the simulated MIPS machine, and not on the host.
+#
+#    However:
+#	(1) if you are experiencing problems with the test executables,
+#	    it would be prudent to rebuild them on the host machine
+#	    on which you are currently running Nachos.  To do this,
+#    	    just type "make distclean", and then "make"
+#
+#	(2) the procedure used to build the test executables does
+#	    depend on the host machine you are on.  All of the machine
+#	    dependencies are isolated in the Makefile.dep file.
+#	    It should be possible to build the test executables on
+#	    any MFCF machine.   In the MFCF environment, this makefile
+#           should automatically figure out what type of host you are
+#	    on, and should use the appropriate procedure.
+#           However, if you are working outside the MFCF environment,
+#           you will need to build a cross-compiler, build coff2noff,
+#           and edit Makefile.dep in this directory before you
+#           can build the test programs.
+#
+#    Nachos assumes that the location of the program startup routine (the
+# 	location the kernel jumps to when the program initially starts up)
+#       is at location 0.  This means: start.o must be the first .o passed
+# 	to ld, in order for the routine "Start" to be loaded at location 0
+#
+#    When you make the test programs, you will see messages like these:
+#		numsections 3
+#		Loading 3 sections:
+#		        ".text", filepos 0xd0, mempos 0x0, size 0x440
+#		        ".data", filepos 0x510, mempos 0x440, size 0x0
+#		        ".bss", filepos 0x0, mempos 0x440, size 0x12c0
+#    These messages are normal.  They come from the coff2noff program.
+#    They are useful in that they tell you how big the various parts of your
+#     compiled user program are, and where in the address space
+#     coff2noff is going to place them.   This information is also
+#     recorded in the header of the executable file that coff2noff
+#     creates.  See the method AddrSpace::Load (in userprog/addrspace.cc)
+#     for an example of how this header is used by the Nachos OS to set up the
+#     address space for a new process that will run the executable.
+#
+#
+# Adding New Test Programs:
+#
+#     You are free to write new test programs, and to modify the
+#	existing programs.   If you write a new program, you will
+# 	need to modify this makefile so that the new program will
+#       get built.
+#     You will need to make the following changes for each program
+#       you add:
+#		(1) add the program's name to PROGRAMS variable definition
+#	 	(2) add dependencies and build commands for the new
+#			program.  The easiest way to do this is to
+#			copy the dependencies and commands for an
+#			existing program, and then change the names.
+#
+#	For example, if you write a test program in foo.c, for which
+#	the executable is to be called foo, you should do the following:
+#
+#	change the PROGRAMS definition to look like this:
+#
+#		PROGRAMS = halt shell matmult sort foo
+#
+#	add these dependencies/commands:
+#
+#		foo.o: foo.c
+#			$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
+#		foo: foo.o start.o
+#			$(LD) $(LDFLAGS) start.o foo.o -o foo.coff
+#			$(COFF2NOFF) foo.coff foo
+#
+#       Be careful when you copy the commands!  The commands
+# 	must be indented with a *TAB*, not a bunch of spaces.

+/* switch.s 
+ *   	Machine dependent context switch routines.  DO NOT MODIFY THESE! 
+ *
+ *	Context switching is inherently machine dependent, since
+ *	the registers to be saved, how to set up an initial
+ *	call frame, etc, are all specific to a processor architecture.
+ *
+ * 	This file currently supports the following architectures:
+ *	    DEC MIPS  (DECMIPS)
+ *	    DEC Alpha  (ALPHA)
+ *	    SUN SPARC (SPARC)
+ *	    HP PA-RISC (PARISC)
+ *	    Intel 386 (x86)
+ *	    IBM RS6000 (PowerPC) -- I hope it will also work for Mac PowerPC
+ *
+ * We define two routines for each architecture:
+ *
+ * ThreadRoot(InitialPC, InitialArg, WhenDonePC, StartupPC)
+ *	InitialPC  - The program counter of the procedure to run
+ *			in this thread.
+ *      InitialArg - The single argument to the thread.
+ *	WhenDonePC - The routine to call when the thread returns.
+ *	StartupPC  - Routine to call when the thread is started.
+ *
+ *	ThreadRoot is called from the SWITCH() routine to start
+ *	a thread for the first time. 
+ *
+ * SWITCH(oldThread, newThread)
+ * 	oldThread  - The current thread that was running, where the
+ *		CPU register state is to be saved.
+ * 	newThread  - The new thread to be run, where the CPU register
+ *		state is to be loaded from.

+// synch.cc
+//	Routines for synchronizing threads.  Three kinds of
+//	synchronization routines are defined here: semaphores, locks
+//   	and condition variables.
+//
+// Any implementation of a synchronization routine needs some
+// primitive atomic operation.  We assume Nachos is running on
+// a uniprocessor, and thus atomicity can be provided by
+// turning off interrupts.  While interrupts are disabled, no
+// context switch can occur, and thus the current thread is guaranteed
+// to hold the CPU throughout, until interrupts are reenabled.
+//
+// Because some of these routines might be called with interrupts
+// already disabled (Semaphore::V for one), instead of turning
+// on interrupts at the end of the atomic operation, we always simply
+// re-set the interrupt state back to its original value (whether
+// that be disabled or enabled).
+//
+// Once we'e implemented one set of higher level atomic operations,
+// we can implement others using that implementation.  We illustrate
+// this by implementing locks and condition variables on top of
+// semaphores, instead of directly enabling and disabling interrupts.
+//
+// Locks are implemented using a semaphore to keep track of
+// whether the lock is held or not -- a semaphore value of 0 means
+// the lock is busy; a semaphore value of 1 means the lock is free.
+//
+// The implementation of condition variables using semaphores is
+// a bit trickier, as explained below under Condition::Wait.

+//	Wait() -- release the lock, relinquish the CPU until signaled,
+//		then re-acquire the lock
+//
+//	Signal() -- wake up a thread, if there are any waiting on
+//		the condition
+//
+//	Broadcast() -- wake up all threads waiting on the condition
+//
+// All operations on a condition variable must be made while
+// the current thread has acquired a lock.  Indeed, all accesses
+// to a given condition variable must be protected by the same lock.
+// In other words, mutual exclusion must be enforced among threads calling
+// the condition variable operations.
+//
+// In Nachos, condition variables are assumed to obey *Mesa*-style
+// semantics.  When a Signal or Broadcast wakes up another thread,
+// it simply puts the thread on the ready list, and it is the responsibility
+// of the woken thread to re-acquire the lock (this re-acquire is
+// taken care of within Wait()).  By contrast, some define condition
+// variables according to *Hoare*-style semantics -- where the signalling
+// thread gives up control over the lock and the CPU to the woken thread,
+// which runs immediately and gives back control over the lock to the
+// signaller when the woken thread leaves the critical section.
+//
+// The consequence of using Mesa-style semantics is that some other thread
+// can acquire the lock, and change data structures, before the woken
+// thread gets a chance to run.  The advantage to Mesa-style semantics
+// is that it is a lot easier to implement than Hoare-style.

+//	Data structures for managing threads.  A thread represents
+//	sequential execution of code within a program.
+//	So the state of a thread includes the program counter,
+//	the processor registers, and the execution stack.
+//
+// 	Note that because we allocate a fixed size stack for each
+//	thread, it is possible to overflow the stack -- for instance,
+//	by recursing to too deep a level.  The most common reason
+//	for this occuring is allocating large data structures
+//	on the stack.  For instance, this will cause problems:
+//
+//		void foo() { int buf[1000]; ...}
+//
+//	Instead, you should allocate all data structures dynamically:
+//
+//		void foo() { int *buf = new int[1000]; ...}
+//
+//
+// 	Bad things happen if you overflow the stack, and in the worst
+//	case, the problem may not be caught explicitly.  Instead,
+//	the only symptom may be bizarre segmentation faults.  (Of course,
+//	other problems can cause seg faults, so that isn't a sure sign
+//	that your thread stacks are too small.)
+//
+//	One thing to try if you find yourself with seg faults is to
+//	increase the size of thread stack -- ThreadStackSize.
+//
+//  	In this interface, forking a thread takes two steps.
+//	We must first allocate a data structure for it: "t = new Thread".
+//	Only then can we do the fork: "t->fork(f, arg)".

+/* coff2noff.c 
+ *
+ * This program reads in a COFF format file, and outputs a NOFF format file.
+ * The NOFF format is essentially just a simpler version of the COFF file,
+ * recording where each segment is in the NOFF file, and where it is to
+ * go in the virtual address space.
+ * 
+ * Assumes coff file is linked with either
+ *	gld with -N -Ttext 0 
+ * 	ld with  -N -T 0
+ * to make sure the object file has no shared text.
+ *
+ * Also assumes that the COFF file has at most 3 segments:
+ *	.text	-- read-only executable instructions 
+ *	.data	-- initialized data
+ *	.bss/.sbss -- uninitialized data (should be zero'd on program startup)
+#ifdef RDATA
+ *      .rdata  -- read-only data (e.g., string literals).
+ *                 mark this segment readonly to prevent it from being modified
+#endif

+/* 
+ * Modified at UW by KMS, August, 1997
+ *   The modified program always writes the NOFF header in little-endian
+ *    format, rather than host format.  This is to avoid the problem
+ *    that user programs run through coff2noff on a big-endian host
+ *    would not run properly on Nachos machines running on little-endian
+ *    hosts.
+ *
+ *    Note that the Nachos address space loading code
+ *    (in AddrSpace::Load) on big-endian hosts converts the header
+ *    to big-endian format when it is read in.
+ *    Thus, the little-endian header NOFF
+ *    header should work OK whether Nachos is running on a little-endian
+ *    host or a big-endian host.

+/* ANSI and traditional C compatibility macros
+
+   ANSI C is assumed if __STDC__ is #defined.
+
+   Macro	ANSI C definition	Traditional C definition
+   -----	---- - ----------	----------- - ----------
+   PTR		`void *'		`char *'
+   LONG_DOUBLE	`long double'		`double'
+   VOLATILE	`volatile'		`'
+   SIGNED	`signed'		`'
+   PTRCONST	`void *const'		`char *'
+   ANSI_PROTOTYPES  1			not defined
+
+   CONST is also defined, but is obsolete.  Just use const.
+
+   obsolete --     DEFUN (name, arglist, args)
+
+	Defines function NAME.
+
+	ARGLIST lists the arguments, separated by commas and enclosed in
+	parentheses.  ARGLIST becomes the argument list in traditional C.
+
+	ARGS list the arguments with their types.  It becomes a prototype in
+	ANSI C, and the type declarations in traditional C.  Arguments should
+	be separated with `AND'.  For functions with a variable number of
+	arguments, the last thing listed should be `DOTS'.
+
+   obsolete --     DEFUN_VOID (name)
+
+	Defines a function NAME, which takes no arguments.
+
+   obsolete --     EXFUN (name, (prototype))	-- obsolete.
+
+	Replaced by PARAMS.  Do not use; will disappear someday soon.
+	Was used in external function declarations.
+	In ANSI C it is `NAME PROTOTYPE' (so PROTOTYPE should be enclosed in
+	parentheses).  In traditional C it is `NAME()'.
+	For a function that takes no arguments, PROTOTYPE should be `(void)'.
+
+   obsolete --     PROTO (type, name, (prototype)    -- obsolete.
+
+	This one has also been replaced by PARAMS.  Do not use.
+
+   PARAMS ((args))
+
+	We could use the EXFUN macro to handle prototype declarations, but
+	the name is misleading and the result is ugly.  So we just define a
+	simple macro to handle the parameter lists, as in:
+
+	      static int foo PARAMS ((int, char));
+
+	This produces:  `static int foo();' or `static int foo (int, char);'
+
+	EXFUN would have done it like this:
+
+	      static int EXFUN (foo, (int, char));
+
+	but the function is not external...and it's hard to visually parse
+	the function name out of the mess.   EXFUN should be considered
+	obsolete; new code should be written to use PARAMS.
+
+   DOTS is also obsolete.
+
+   Examples:
+
+	extern int printf PARAMS ((const char *format, ...));

+The C Preprocessor
+******************
+
+   The C preprocessor is a "macro processor" that is used automatically
+by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.
+It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define "macros",
+which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.
+
+   The C preprocessor provides four separate facilities that you can
+use as you see fit:
+
+   * Inclusion of header files.  These are files of declarations that
+     can be substituted into your program.
+
+   * Macro expansion.  You can define "macros", which are abbreviations
+     for arbitrary fragments of C code, and then the C preprocessor will
+     replace the macros with their definitions throughout the program.
+
+   * Conditional compilation.  Using special preprocessing directives,
+     you can include or exclude parts of the program according to
+     various conditions.
+
+   * Line control.  If you use a program to combine or rearrange source
+     files into an intermediate file which is then compiled, you can
+     use line control to inform the compiler of where each source line
+     originally came from.
+
+   C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU
+C preprocessor, the C Compatible Compiler Preprocessor.  The GNU C
+preprocessor provides a superset of the features of ANSI Standard C.
+
+   ANSI Standard C requires the rejection of many harmless constructs
+commonly used by today's C programs.  Such incompatibility would be
+inconvenient for users, so the GNU C preprocessor is configured to
+accept these constructs by default.  Strictly speaking, to get ANSI
+Standard C, you must use the options `-trigraphs', `-undef' and
+`-pedantic', but in practice the consequences of having strict ANSI
+Standard C make it undesirable to do this.  *Note Invocation::.
+
+   The C preprocessor is designed for C-like languages; you may run into
+problems if you apply it to other kinds of languages, because it assumes
+that it is dealing with C.  For example, the C preprocessor sometimes
+outputs extra white space to avoid inadvertent C token concatenation,
+and this may cause problems with other languages.

+
+Transformations Made Globally
+=============================
+
+   Most C preprocessor features are inactive unless you give specific
+directives to request their use.  (Preprocessing directives are lines
+starting with `#'; *note Directives::.).  But there are three
+transformations that the preprocessor always makes on all the input it
+receives, even in the absence of directives.
+
+   * All C comments are replaced with single spaces.
+
+   * Backslash-Newline sequences are deleted, no matter where.  This
+     feature allows you to break long lines for cosmetic purposes
+     without changing their meaning.
+
+   * Predefined macro names are replaced with their expansions (*note
+     Predefined::.).
+
+   The first two transformations are done *before* nearly all other
+parsing and before preprocessing directives are recognized.  Thus, for
+example, you can split a line cosmetically with Backslash-Newline
+anywhere (except when trigraphs are in use; see below).
+
+     /*
+     */ # /*
+     */ defi\
+     ne FO\
+     O 10\
+     20
+
+is equivalent into `#define FOO 1020'.  You can split even an escape
+sequence with Backslash-Newline.  For example, you can split `"foo\bar"'
+between the `\' and the `b' to get
+
+     "foo\\
+     bar"
+
+This behavior is unclean: in all other contexts, a Backslash can be
+inserted in a string constant as an ordinary character by writing a
+double Backslash, and this creates an exception.  But the ANSI C
+standard requires it.  (Strict ANSI C does not allow Newlines in string
+constants, so they do not consider this a problem.)
+
+   But there are a few exceptions to all three transformations.
+
+   * C comments and predefined macro names are not recognized inside a
+     `#include' directive in which the file name is delimited with `<'
+     and `>'.
+
+   * C comments and predefined macro names are never recognized within a
+     character or string constant.  (Strictly speaking, this is the
+     rule, not an exception, but it is worth noting here anyway.)
+
+   * Backslash-Newline may not safely be used within an ANSI "trigraph".
+     Trigraphs are converted before Backslash-Newline is deleted.  If
+     you write what looks like a trigraph with a Backslash-Newline
+     inside, the Backslash-Newline is deleted as usual, but it is then
+     too late to recognize the trigraph.
+
+     This exception is relevant only if you use the `-trigraphs' option
+     to enable trigraph processing.  *Note Invocation::.
+

+File: cpp.info,  Node: Directives,  Next: Header Files,  Prev: Global Actions,  Up: Top
+
+Preprocessing Directives
+========================
+
+   Most preprocessor features are active only if you use preprocessing
+directives to request their use.
+
+   Preprocessing directives are lines in your program that start with
+`#'.  The `#' is followed by an identifier that is the "directive name".
+For example, `#define' is the directive that defines a macro.
+Whitespace is also allowed before and after the `#'.
+
+   The set of valid directive names is fixed.  Programs cannot define
+new preprocessing directives.
+
+   Some directive names require arguments; these make up the rest of
+the directive line and must be separated from the directive name by
+whitespace.  For example, `#define' must be followed by a macro name
+and the intended expansion of the macro.  *Note Simple Macros::.
+
+   A preprocessing directive cannot be more than one line in normal
+circumstances.  It may be split cosmetically with Backslash-Newline,
+but that has no effect on its meaning.  Comments containing Newlines
+can also divide the directive into multiple lines, but the comments are
+changed to Spaces before the directive is interpreted.  The only way a
+significant Newline can occur in a preprocessing directive is within a
+string constant or character constant.  Note that most C compilers that
+might be applied to the output from the preprocessor do not accept
+string or character constants containing Newlines.
+
+   The `#' and the directive name cannot come from a macro expansion.
+For example, if `foo' is defined as a macro expanding to `define', that
+does not make `#foo' a valid preprocessing directive.

+
+Header Files
+============
+
+   A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro
+definitions (*note Macros::.) to be shared between several source
+files.  You request the use of a header file in your program with the C
+preprocessing directive `#include'.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Header Uses::         What header files are used for.
+* Include Syntax::      How to write `#include' directives.
+* Include Operation::   What `#include' does.
+* Once-Only::		Preventing multiple inclusion of one header file.
+* Inheritance::         Including one header file in another header file.
+
+
+File: cpp.info,  Node: Header Uses,  Next: Include Syntax,  Prev: Header Files,  Up: Header Files
+
+Uses of Header Files
+--------------------
+
+   Header files serve two kinds of purposes.
+
+   * System header files declare the interfaces to parts of the
+     operating system.  You include them in your program to supply the
+     definitions and declarations you need to invoke system calls and
+     libraries.
+
+   * Your own header files contain declarations for interfaces between
+     the source files of your program.  Each time you have a group of
+     related declarations and macro definitions all or most of which
+     are needed in several different source files, it is a good idea to
+     create a header file for them.
+
+   Including a header file produces the same results in C compilation as
+copying the header file into each source file that needs it.  But such
+copying would be time-consuming and error-prone.  With a header file,
+the related declarations appear in only one place.  If they need to be
+changed, they can be changed in one place, and programs that include
+the header file will automatically use the new version when next
+recompiled.  The header file eliminates the labor of finding and
+changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to find one
+copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.
+
+   The usual convention is to give header files names that end with
+`.h'.  Avoid unusual characters in header file names, as they reduce
+portability.
+

+File: cpp.info,  Node: Include Syntax,  Next: Include Operation,  Prev: Header Uses,  Up: Header Files
+
+The `#include' Directive
+------------------------
+
+   Both user and system header files are included using the
+preprocessing directive `#include'.  It has three variants:
+
+`#include <FILE>'
+     This variant is used for system header files.  It searches for a
+     file named FILE in a list of directories specified by you, then in
+     a standard list of system directories.  You specify directories to
+     search for header files with the command option `-I' (*note
+     Invocation::.).  The option `-nostdinc' inhibits searching the
+     standard system directories; in this case only the directories you
+     specify are searched.
+
+     The parsing of this form of `#include' is slightly special because
+     comments are not recognized within the `<...>'.  Thus, in
+     `#include <x/*y>' the `/*' does not start a comment and the
+     directive specifies inclusion of a system header file named
+     `x/*y'.  Of course, a header file with such a name is unlikely to
+     exist on Unix, where shell wildcard features would make it hard to
+     manipulate.
+
+     The argument FILE may not contain a `>' character.  It may,
+     however, contain a `<' character.
+
+`#include "FILE"'
+     This variant is used for header files of your own program.  It
+     searches for a file named FILE first in the current directory,
+     then in the same directories used for system header files.  The
+     current directory is the directory of the current input file.  It
+     is tried first because it is presumed to be the location of the
+     files that the current input file refers to.  (If the `-I-' option
+     is used, the special treatment of the current directory is
+     inhibited.)
+
+     The argument FILE may not contain `"' characters.  If backslashes
+     occur within FILE, they are considered ordinary text characters,
+     not escape characters.  None of the character escape sequences
+     appropriate to string constants in C are processed.  Thus,
+     `#include "x\n\\y"' specifies a filename containing three
+     backslashes.  It is not clear why this behavior is ever useful, but
+     the ANSI standard specifies it.
+
+`#include ANYTHING ELSE'
+     This variant is called a "computed #include".  Any `#include'
+     directive whose argument does not fit the above two forms is a
+     computed include.  The text ANYTHING ELSE is checked for macro
+     calls, which are expanded (*note Macros::.).  When this is done,
+     the result must fit one of the above two variants--in particular,
+     the expanded text must in the end be surrounded by either quotes
+     or angle braces.
+
+     This feature allows you to define a macro which controls the file
+     name to be used at a later point in the program.  One application
+     of this is to allow a site-specific configuration file for your
+     program to specify the names of the system include files to be
+     used.  This can help in porting the program to various operating
+     systems in which the necessary system header files are found in
+     different places.
+
+
+File: cpp.info,  Node: Include Operation,  Next: Once-Only,  Prev: Include Syntax,  Up: Header Files
+
+How `#include' Works
+--------------------
+
+   The `#include' directive works by directing the C preprocessor to
+scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the
+current file.  The output from the preprocessor contains the output
+already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included
+file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the
+`#include' directive.  For example, given a header file `header.h' as
+follows,
+
+     char *test ();
+
+and a main program called `program.c' that uses the header file, like
+this,
+
+     int x;
+     #include "header.h"
+     
+     main ()
+     {
+       printf (test ());
+     }
+
+the output generated by the C preprocessor for `program.c' as input
+would be
+
+     int x;
+     char *test ();
+     
+     main ()
+     {
+       printf (test ());
+     }
+
+   Included files are not limited to declarations and macro
+definitions; those are merely the typical uses.  Any fragment of a C
+program can be included from another file.  The include file could even
+contain the beginning of a statement that is concluded in the
+containing file, or the end of a statement that was started in the
+including file.  However, a comment or a string or character constant
+may not start in the included file and finish in the including file.
+An unterminated comment, string constant or character constant in an
+included file is considered to end (with an error message) at the end
+of the file.
+
+   It is possible for a header file to begin or end a syntactic unit
+such as a function definition, but that would be very confusing, so
+don't do it.
+
+   The line following the `#include' directive is always treated as a
+separate line by the C preprocessor even if the included file lacks a
+final newline.
+
+
+File: cpp.info,  Node: Once-Only,  Next: Inheritance,  Prev: Include Operation,  Up: Header Files
+
+Once-Only Include Files
+-----------------------
+
+   Very often, one header file includes another.  It can easily result
+that a certain header file is included more than once.  This may lead
+to errors, if the header file defines structure types or typedefs, and
+is certainly wasteful.  Therefore, we often wish to prevent multiple
+inclusion of a header file.
+
+   The standard way to do this is to enclose the entire real contents
+of the file in a conditional, like this:
+
+     #ifndef FILE_FOO_SEEN
+     #define FILE_FOO_SEEN
+     
+     THE ENTIRE FILE
+     
+     #endif /* FILE_FOO_SEEN */
+
+   The macro `FILE_FOO_SEEN' indicates that the file has been included
+once already.  In a user header file, the macro name should not begin
+with `_'.  In a system header file, this name should begin with `__' to
+avoid conflicts with user programs.  In any kind of header file, the
+macro name should contain the name of the file and some additional
+text, to avoid conflicts with other header files.
+
+   The GNU C preprocessor is programmed to notice when a header file
+uses this particular construct and handle it efficiently.  If a header
+file is contained entirely in a `#ifndef' conditional, then it records
+that fact.  If a subsequent `#include' specifies the same file, and the
+macro in the `#ifndef' is already defined, then the file is entirely
+skipped, without even reading it.
+
+   There is also an explicit directive to tell the preprocessor that it
+need not include a file more than once.  This is called `#pragma once',
+and was used *in addition to* the `#ifndef' conditional around the
+contents of the header file.  `#pragma once' is now obsolete and should
+not be used at all.
+
+   In the Objective C language, there is a variant of `#include' called
+`#import' which includes a file, but does so at most once.  If you use
+`#import' *instead of* `#include', then you don't need the conditionals
+inside the header file to prevent multiple execution of the contents.
+
+   `#import' is obsolete because it is not a well designed feature.  It
+requires the users of a header file--the applications programmers--to
+know that a certain header file should only be included once.  It is
+much better for the header file's implementor to write the file so that
+users don't need to know this.  Using `#ifndef' accomplishes this goal.

+
+Inheritance and Header Files
+----------------------------
+
+   "Inheritance" is what happens when one object or file derives some
+of its contents by virtual copying from another object or file.  In the
+case of C header files, inheritance means that one header file includes
+another header file and then replaces or adds something.
+
+   If the inheriting header file and the base header file have different
+names, then inheritance is straightforward: simply write `#include
+"BASE"' in the inheriting file.
+
+   Sometimes it is necessary to give the inheriting file the same name
+as the base file.  This is less straightforward.
+
+   For example, suppose an application program uses the system header
+`sys/signal.h', but the version of `/usr/include/sys/signal.h' on a
+particular system doesn't do what the application program expects.  It
+might be convenient to define a "local" version, perhaps under the name
+`/usr/local/include/sys/signal.h', to override or add to the one
+supplied by the system.
+
+   You can do this by compiling with the option `-I.', and writing a
+file `sys/signal.h' that does what the application program expects.
+But making this file include the standard `sys/signal.h' is not so
+easy--writing `#include <sys/signal.h>' in that file doesn't work,
+because it includes your own version of the file, not the standard
+system version.  Used in that file itself, this leads to an infinite
+recursion and a fatal error in compilation.
+
+   `#include </usr/include/sys/signal.h>' would find the proper file,
+but that is not clean, since it makes an assumption about where the
+system header file is found.  This is bad for maintenance, since it
+means that any change in where the system's header files are kept
+requires a change somewhere else.
+
+   The clean way to solve this problem is to use `#include_next', which
+means, "Include the *next* file with this name."  This directive works
+like `#include' except in searching for the specified file: it starts
+searching the list of header file directories *after* the directory in
+which the current file was found.
+
+   Suppose you specify `-I /usr/local/include', and the list of
+directories to search also includes `/usr/include'; and suppose both
+directories contain `sys/signal.h'.  Ordinary `#include <sys/signal.h>'
+finds the file under `/usr/local/include'.  If that file contains
+`#include_next <sys/signal.h>', it starts searching after that
+directory, and finds the file in `/usr/include'.

+
+Simple Macros
+-------------
+
+   A "simple macro" is a kind of abbreviation.  It is a name which
+stands for a fragment of code.  Some people refer to these as "manifest
+constants".
+
+   Before you can use a macro, you must "define" it explicitly with the
+`#define' directive.  `#define' is followed by the name of the macro
+and then the code it should be an abbreviation for.  For example,
+
+     #define BUFFER_SIZE 1020
+
+defines a macro named `BUFFER_SIZE' as an abbreviation for the text
+`1020'.  If somewhere after this `#define' directive there comes a C
+statement of the form
+
+     foo = (char *) xmalloc (BUFFER_SIZE);
+
+then the C preprocessor will recognize and "expand" the macro
+`BUFFER_SIZE', resulting in
+
+     foo = (char *) xmalloc (1020);
+
+   The use of all upper case for macro names is a standard convention.
+Programs are easier to read when it is possible to tell at a glance
+which names are macros.
+
+   Normally, a macro definition must be a single line, like all C
+preprocessing directives.  (You can split a long macro definition
+cosmetically with Backslash-Newline.)  There is one exception: Newlines
+can be included in the macro definition if within a string or character
+constant.  This is because it is not possible for a macro definition to
+contain an unbalanced quote character; the definition automatically
+extends to include the matching quote character that ends the string or
+character constant.  Comments within a macro definition may contain
+Newlines, which make no difference since the comments are entirely
+replaced with Spaces regardless of their contents.
+
+   Aside from the above, there is no restriction on what can go in a
+macro body.  Parentheses need not balance.  The body need not resemble
+valid C code.  (But if it does not, you may get error messages from the
+C compiler when you use the macro.)
+
+   The C preprocessor scans your program sequentially, so macro
+definitions take effect at the place you write them.  Therefore, the
+following input to the C preprocessor
+
+     foo = X;
+     #define X 4
+     bar = X;
+
+produces as output
+
+     foo = X;
+     
+     bar = 4;
+
+   After the preprocessor expands a macro name, the macro's definition
+body is appended to the front of the remaining input, and the check for
+macro calls continues.  Therefore, the macro body can contain calls to
+other macros.  For example, after
+
+     #define BUFSIZE 1020
+     #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
+
+the name `TABLESIZE' when used in the program would go through two
+stages of expansion, resulting ultimately in `1020'.
+
+   This is not at all the same as defining `TABLESIZE' to be `1020'.
+The `#define' for `TABLESIZE' uses exactly the body you specify--in
+this case, `BUFSIZE'--and does not check to see whether it too is the
+name of a macro.  It's only when you *use* `TABLESIZE' that the result
+of its expansion is checked for more macro names.  *Note Cascaded
+Macros::.

+
+Macros with Arguments
+---------------------
+
+   A simple macro always stands for exactly the same text, each time it
+is used.  Macros can be more flexible when they accept "arguments".
+Arguments are fragments of code that you supply each time the macro is
+used.  These fragments are included in the expansion of the macro
+according to the directions in the macro definition.  A macro that
+accepts arguments is called a "function-like macro" because the syntax
+for using it looks like a function call.
+
+   To define a macro that uses arguments, you write a `#define'
+directive with a list of "argument names" in parentheses after the name
+of the macro.  The argument names may be any valid C identifiers,
+separated by commas and optionally whitespace.  The open-parenthesis
+must follow the macro name immediately, with no space in between.
+
+   For example, here is a macro that computes the minimum of two numeric
+values, as it is defined in many C programs:
+
+     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
+
+(This is not the best way to define a "minimum" macro in GNU C.  *Note
+Side Effects::, for more information.)
+
+   To use a macro that expects arguments, you write the name of the
+macro followed by a list of "actual arguments" in parentheses,
+separated by commas.  The number of actual arguments you give must
+match the number of arguments the macro expects.   Examples of use of
+the macro `min' include `min (1, 2)' and `min (x + 28, *p)'.
+
+   The expansion text of the macro depends on the arguments you use.
+Each of the argument names of the macro is replaced, throughout the
+macro definition, with the corresponding actual argument.  Using the
+same macro `min' defined above, `min (1, 2)' expands into
+
+     ((1) < (2) ? (1) : (2))
+
+where `1' has been substituted for `X' and `2' for `Y'.
+
+   Likewise, `min (x + 28, *p)' expands into
+
+     ((x + 28) < (*p) ? (x + 28) : (*p))
+
+   Parentheses in the actual arguments must balance; a comma within
+parentheses does not end an argument.  However, there is no requirement
+for brackets or braces to balance, and they do not prevent a comma from
+separating arguments.  Thus,
+
+     macro (array[x = y, x + 1])
+
+passes two arguments to `macro': `array[x = y' and `x + 1]'.  If you
+want to supply `array[x = y, x + 1]' as an argument, you must write it
+as `array[(x = y, x + 1)]', which is equivalent C code.
+
+   After the actual arguments are substituted into the macro body, the
+entire result is appended to the front of the remaining input, and the
+check for macro calls continues.  Therefore, the actual arguments can
+contain calls to other macros, either with or without arguments, or
+even to the same macro.  The macro body can also contain calls to other
+macros.  For example, `min (min (a, b), c)' expands into this text:
+
+     ((((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))) < (c)
+      ? (((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b)))
+      : (c))
+
+(Line breaks shown here for clarity would not actually be generated.)
+
+   If a macro `foo' takes one argument, and you want to supply an empty
+argument, you must write at least some whitespace between the
+parentheses, like this: `foo ( )'.  Just `foo ()' is providing no
+arguments, which is an error if `foo' expects an argument.  But `foo0
+()' is the correct way to call a macro defined to take zero arguments,
+like this:
+
+     #define foo0() ...
+
+   If you use the macro name followed by something other than an
+open-parenthesis (after ignoring any spaces, tabs and comments that
+follow), it is not a call to the macro, and the preprocessor does not
+change what you have written.  Therefore, it is possible for the same
+name to be a variable or function in your program as well as a macro,
+and you can choose in each instance whether to refer to the macro (if
+an actual argument list follows) or the variable or function (if an
+argument list does not follow).
+
+   Such dual use of one name could be confusing and should be avoided
+except when the two meanings are effectively synonymous: that is, when
+the name is both a macro and a function and the two have similar
+effects.  You can think of the name simply as a function; use of the
+name for purposes other than calling it (such as, to take the address)
+will refer to the function, while calls will expand the macro and
+generate better but equivalent code.  For example, you can use a
+function named `min' in the same source file that defines the macro.
+If you write `&min' with no argument list, you refer to the function.
+If you write `min (x, bb)', with an argument list, the macro is
+expanded.  If you write `(min) (a, bb)', where the name `min' is not
+followed by an open-parenthesis, the macro is not expanded, so you wind
+up with a call to the function `min'.
+
+   You may not define the same name as both a simple macro and a macro
+with arguments.
+
+   In the definition of a macro with arguments, the list of argument
+names must follow the macro name immediately with no space in between.
+If there is a space after the macro name, the macro is defined as
+taking no arguments, and all the rest of the line is taken to be the
+expansion.  The reason for this is that it is often useful to define a
+macro that takes no arguments and whose definition begins with an
+identifier in parentheses.  This rule about spaces makes it possible
+for you to do either this:
+
+     #define FOO(x) - 1 / (x)
+
+(which defines `FOO' to take an argument and expand into minus the
+reciprocal of that argument) or this:
+
+     #define BAR (x) - 1 / (x)
+
+(which defines `BAR' to take no argument and always expand into `(x) -
+1 / (x)').
+
+   Note that the *uses* of a macro with arguments can have spaces before
+the left parenthesis; it's the *definition* where it matters whether
+there is a space.

+Predefined Macros
+-----------------
+
+   Several simple macros are predefined.  You can use them without
+giving definitions for them.  They fall into two classes: standard
+macros and system-specific macros.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Standard Predefined::     Standard predefined macros.
+* Nonstandard Predefined::  Nonstandard predefined macros.
+

+File: cpp.info,  Node: Standard Predefined,  Next: Nonstandard Predefined,  Prev: Predefined,  Up: Predefined
+
+Standard Predefined Macros
+..........................
+
+   The standard predefined macros are available with the same meanings
+regardless of the machine or operating system on which you are using
+GNU C.  Their names all start and end with double underscores.  Those
+preceding `__GNUC__' in this table are standardized by ANSI C; the rest
+are GNU C extensions.
+
+`__FILE__'
+     This macro expands to the name of the current input file, in the
+     form of a C string constant.  The precise name returned is the one
+     that was specified in `#include' or as the input file name
+     argument.
+
+`__LINE__'
+     This macro expands to the current input line number, in the form
+     of a decimal integer constant.  While we call it a predefined
+     macro, it's a pretty strange macro, since its "definition" changes
+     with each new line of source code.
+
+     This and `__FILE__' are useful in generating an error message to
+     report an inconsistency detected by the program; the message can
+     state the source line at which the inconsistency was detected.
+     For example,
+
+          fprintf (stderr, "Internal error: "
+                           "negative string length "
+                           "%d at %s, line %d.",
+                   length, __FILE__, __LINE__);
+
+     A `#include' directive changes the expansions of `__FILE__' and
+     `__LINE__' to correspond to the included file.  At the end of that
+     file, when processing resumes on the input file that contained the
+     `#include' directive, the expansions of `__FILE__' and `__LINE__'
+     revert to the values they had before the `#include' (but
+     `__LINE__' is then incremented by one as processing moves to the
+     line after the `#include').
+
+     The expansions of both `__FILE__' and `__LINE__' are altered if a
+     `#line' directive is used.  *Note Combining Sources::.
+
+`__DATE__'
+     This macro expands to a string constant that describes the date on
+     which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
+     eleven characters and looks like `"Feb  1 1996"'.
+
+`__TIME__'
+     This macro expands to a string constant that describes the time at
+     which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
+     eight characters and looks like `"23:59:01"'.
+
+`__STDC__'
+     This macro expands to the constant 1, to signify that this is ANSI
+     Standard C.  (Whether that is actually true depends on what C
+     compiler will operate on the output from the preprocessor.)
+
+     On some hosts, system include files use a different convention,
+     where `__STDC__' is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies
+     strict conformance to the C Standard.  The preprocessor follows
+     the host convention when processing system include files, but when
+     processing user files it follows the usual GNU C convention.
+
+     This macro is not defined if the `-traditional' option is used.
+
+`__STDC_VERSION__'
+     This macro expands to the C Standard's version number, a long
+     integer constant of the form `YYYYMML' where YYYY and MM are the
+     year and month of the Standard version.  This signifies which
+     version of the C Standard the preprocessor conforms to.  Like
+     `__STDC__', whether this version number is accurate for the entire
+     implementation depends on what C compiler will operate on the
+     output from the preprocessor.
+
+     This macro is not defined if the `-traditional' option is used.
+
+`__GNUC__'
+     This macro is defined if and only if this is GNU C.  This macro is
+     defined only when the entire GNU C compiler is in use; if you
+     invoke the preprocessor directly, `__GNUC__' is undefined.  The
+     value identifies the major version number of GNU CC (`1' for GNU CC
+     version 1, which is now obsolete, and `2' for version 2).
+
+`__GNUC_MINOR__'
+     The macro contains the minor version number of the compiler.  This
+     can be used to work around differences between different releases
+     of the compiler (for example, if gcc 2.6.3 is known to support a
+     feature, you can test for `__GNUC__ > 2 || (__GNUC__ == 2 &&
+     __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 6)').  The last number, `3' in the example
+     above, denotes the bugfix level of the compiler; no macro contains
+     this value.
+
+`__GNUG__'
+     The GNU C compiler defines this when the compilation language is
+     C++; use `__GNUG__' to distinguish between GNU C and GNU C++.
+
+`__cplusplus'
+     The draft ANSI standard for C++ used to require predefining this
+     variable.  Though it is no longer required, GNU C++ continues to
+     define it, as do other popular C++ compilers.  You can use
+     `__cplusplus' to test whether a header is compiled by a C compiler
+     or a C++ compiler.
+
+`__STRICT_ANSI__'
+     GNU C defines this macro if and only if the `-ansi' switch was
+     specified when GNU C was invoked.  Its definition is the null
+     string.  This macro exists primarily to direct certain GNU header
+     files not to define certain traditional Unix constructs which are
+     incompatible with ANSI C.
+
+`__BASE_FILE__'
+     This macro expands to the name of the main input file, in the form
+     of a C string constant.  This is the source file that was specified
+     as an argument when the C compiler was invoked.
+
+`__INCLUDE_LEVEL__'
+     This macro expands to a decimal integer constant that represents
+     the depth of nesting in include files.  The value of this macro is
+     incremented on every `#include' directive and decremented at every
+     end of file.  For input files specified by command line arguments,
+     the nesting level is zero.
+
+`__VERSION__'
+     This macro expands to a string constant which describes the
+     version number of GNU C.  The string is normally a sequence of
+     decimal numbers separated by periods, such as `"2.6.0"'.
+
+`__OPTIMIZE__'
+     GNU CC defines this macro in optimizing compilations.  It causes
+     certain GNU header files to define alternative macro definitions
+     for some system library functions.  You should not refer to or
+     test the definition of this macro unless you make very sure that
+     programs will execute with the same effect regardless.
+
+`__CHAR_UNSIGNED__'
+     GNU C defines this macro if and only if the data type `char' is
+     unsigned on the target machine.  It exists to cause the standard
+     header file `limits.h' to work correctly.  You should not refer to
+     this macro yourself; instead, refer to the standard macros defined
+     in `limits.h'.  The preprocessor uses this macro to determine
+     whether or not to sign-extend large character constants written in
+     octal; see *Note The `#if' Directive: #if Directive.
+
+`__REGISTER_PREFIX__'
+     This macro expands to a string (not a string constant) describing
+     the prefix applied to CPU registers in assembler code.  You can
+     use it to write assembler code that is usable in multiple
+     environments.  For example, in the `m68k-aout' environment it
+     expands to the null string, but in the `m68k-coff' environment it
+     expands to the string `%'.
+
+`__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__'
+     Similar to `__REGISTER_PREFIX__', but describes the prefix applied
+     to user generated labels in assembler code.  For example, in the
+     `m68k-aout' environment it expands to the string `_', but in the
+     `m68k-coff' environment it expands to the null string.  This does
+     not work with the `-mno-underscores' option that the i386 OSF/rose
+     and m88k targets provide nor with the `-mcall*' options of the
+     rs6000 System V Release 4 target.

+
+Nonstandard Predefined Macros
+.............................
+
+   The C preprocessor normally has several predefined macros that vary
+between machines because their purpose is to indicate what type of
+system and machine is in use.  This manual, being for all systems and
+machines, cannot tell you exactly what their names are; instead, we
+offer a list of some typical ones.  You can use `cpp -dM' to see the
+values of predefined macros; see *Note Invocation::.
+
+   Some nonstandard predefined macros describe the operating system in
+use, with more or less specificity.  For example,
+
+`unix'
+     `unix' is normally predefined on all Unix systems.
+
+`BSD'
+     `BSD' is predefined on recent versions of Berkeley Unix (perhaps
+     only in version 4.3).
+
+   Other nonstandard predefined macros describe the kind of CPU, with
+more or less specificity.  For example,
+
+`vax'
+     `vax' is predefined on Vax computers.
+
+`mc68000'
+     `mc68000' is predefined on most computers whose CPU is a Motorola
+     68000, 68010 or 68020.
+
+`m68k'
+     `m68k' is also predefined on most computers whose CPU is a 68000,
+     68010 or 68020; however, some makers use `mc68000' and some use
+     `m68k'.  Some predefine both names.  What happens in GNU C depends
+     on the system you are using it on.
+
+`M68020'
+     `M68020' has been observed to be predefined on some systems that
+     use 68020 CPUs--in addition to `mc68000' and `m68k', which are
+     less specific.
+
+`_AM29K'
+`_AM29000'
+     Both `_AM29K' and `_AM29000' are predefined for the AMD 29000 CPU
+     family.
+
+`ns32000'
+     `ns32000' is predefined on computers which use the National
+     Semiconductor 32000 series CPU.
+
+   Yet other nonstandard predefined macros describe the manufacturer of
+the system.  For example,
+
+`sun'
+     `sun' is predefined on all models of Sun computers.
+
+`pyr'
+     `pyr' is predefined on all models of Pyramid computers.
+
+`sequent'
+     `sequent' is predefined on all models of Sequent computers.
+
+   These predefined symbols are not only nonstandard, they are contrary
+to the ANSI standard because their names do not start with underscores.
+Therefore, the option `-ansi' inhibits the definition of these symbols.
+
+   This tends to make `-ansi' useless, since many programs depend on the
+customary nonstandard predefined symbols.  Even system header files
+check them and will generate incorrect declarations if they do not find
+the names that are expected.  You might think that the header files
+supplied for the Uglix computer would not need to test what machine
+they are running on, because they can simply assume it is the Uglix;
+but often they do, and they do so using the customary names.  As a
+result, very few C programs will compile with `-ansi'.  We intend to
+avoid such problems on the GNU system.
+
+   What, then, should you do in an ANSI C program to test the type of
+machine it will run on?
+
+   GNU C offers a parallel series of symbols for this purpose, whose
+names are made from the customary ones by adding `__' at the beginning
+and end.  Thus, the symbol `__vax__' would be available on a Vax, and
+so on.
+
+   The set of nonstandard predefined names in the GNU C preprocessor is
+controlled (when `cpp' is itself compiled) by the macro
+`CPP_PREDEFINES', which should be a string containing `-D' options,
+separated by spaces.  For example, on the Sun 3, we use the following
+definition:
+
+     #define CPP_PREDEFINES "-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix -Dm68k"
+
+This macro is usually specified in `tm.h'.

+   "Stringification" means turning a code fragment into a string
+constant whose contents are the text for the code fragment.  For
+example, stringifying `foo (z)' results in `"foo (z)"'.
+
+   In the C preprocessor, stringification is an option available when
+macro arguments are substituted into the macro definition.  In the body
+of the definition, when an argument name appears, the character `#'
+before the name specifies stringification of the corresponding actual
+argument when it is substituted at that point in the definition.  The
+same argument may be substituted in other places in the definition
+without stringification if the argument name appears in those places
+with no `#'.
+
+   Here is an example of a macro definition that uses stringification:
+
+     #define WARN_IF(EXP) \
+     do { if (EXP) \
+             fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " #EXP "\n"); } \
+     while (0)
+
+Here the actual argument for `EXP' is substituted once as given, into
+the `if' statement, and once as stringified, into the argument to
+`fprintf'.  The `do' and `while (0)' are a kludge to make it possible
+to write `WARN_IF (ARG);', which the resemblance of `WARN_IF' to a
+function would make C programmers want to do; see *Note Swallow
+Semicolon::.
+
+   The stringification feature is limited to transforming one macro
+argument into one string constant: there is no way to combine the
+argument with other text and then stringify it all together.  But the
+example above shows how an equivalent result can be obtained in ANSI
+Standard C using the feature that adjacent string constants are
+concatenated as one string constant.  The preprocessor stringifies the
+actual value of `EXP' into a separate string constant, resulting in
+text like
+
+     do { if (x == 0) \
+             fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " "x == 0" "\n"); } \
+     while (0)
+
+but the C compiler then sees three consecutive string constants and
+concatenates them into one, producing effectively
+
+     do { if (x == 0) \
+             fprintf (stderr, "Warning: x == 0\n"); } \
+     while (0)
+
+   Stringification in C involves more than putting doublequote
+characters around the fragment; it is necessary to put backslashes in
+front of all doublequote characters, and all backslashes in string and
+character constants, in order to get a valid C string constant with the
+proper contents.  Thus, stringifying `p = "foo\n";' results in `"p =
+\"foo\\n\";"'.  However, backslashes that are not inside of string or
+character constants are not duplicated: `\n' by itself stringifies to
+`"\n"'.
+
+   Whitespace (including comments) in the text being stringified is
+handled according to precise rules.  All leading and trailing
+whitespace is ignored.  Any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the
+text is converted to a single space in the stringified result.

+
+Concatenation
+-------------
+
+   "Concatenation" means joining two strings into one.  In the context
+of macro expansion, concatenation refers to joining two lexical units
+into one longer one.  Specifically, an actual argument to the macro can
+be concatenated with another actual argument or with fixed text to
+produce a longer name.  The longer name might be the name of a function,
+variable or type, or a C keyword; it might even be the name of another
+macro, in which case it will be expanded.
+
+   When you define a macro, you request concatenation with the special
+operator `##' in the macro body.  When the macro is called, after
+actual arguments are substituted, all `##' operators are deleted, and
+so is any whitespace next to them (including whitespace that was part
+of an actual argument).  The result is to concatenate the syntactic
+tokens on either side of the `##'.
+
+   Consider a C program that interprets named commands.  There probably
+needs to be a table of commands, perhaps an array of structures
+declared as follows:
+
+     struct command
+     {
+       char *name;
+       void (*function) ();
+     };
+     
+     struct command commands[] =
+     {
+       { "quit", quit_command},
+       { "help", help_command},
+       ...
+     };
+
+   It would be cleaner not to have to give each command name twice,
+once in the string constant and once in the function name.  A macro
+which takes the name of a command as an argument can make this
+unnecessary.  The string constant can be created with stringification,
+and the function name by concatenating the argument with `_command'.
+Here is how it is done:
+
+     #define COMMAND(NAME)  { #NAME, NAME ## _command }
+     
+     struct command commands[] =
+     {
+       COMMAND (quit),
+       COMMAND (help),
+       ...
+     };
+
+   The usual case of concatenation is concatenating two names (or a
+name and a number) into a longer name.  But this isn't the only valid
+case.  It is also possible to concatenate two numbers (or a number and
+a name, such as `1.5' and `e3') into a number.  Also, multi-character
+operators such as `+=' can be formed by concatenation.  In some cases
+it is even possible to piece together a string constant.  However, two
+pieces of text that don't together form a valid lexical unit cannot be
+concatenated.  For example, concatenation with `x' on one side and `+'
+on the other is not meaningful because those two characters can't fit
+together in any lexical unit of C.  The ANSI standard says that such
+attempts at concatenation are undefined, but in the GNU C preprocessor
+it is well defined: it puts the `x' and `+' side by side with no
+particular special results.
+
+   Keep in mind that the C preprocessor converts comments to whitespace
+before macros are even considered.  Therefore, you cannot create a
+comment by concatenating `/' and `*': the `/*' sequence that starts a
+comment is not a lexical unit, but rather the beginning of a "long"
+space character.  Also, you can freely use comments next to a `##' in a
+macro definition, or in actual arguments that will be concatenated,
+because the comments will be converted to spaces at first sight, and
+concatenation will later discard the spaces.

+
+Undefining Macros
+-----------------
+
+   To "undefine" a macro means to cancel its definition.  This is done
+with the `#undef' directive.  `#undef' is followed by the macro name to
+be undefined.
+
+   Like definition, undefinition occurs at a specific point in the
+source file, and it applies starting from that point.  The name ceases
+to be a macro name, and from that point on it is treated by the
+preprocessor as if it had never been a macro name.
+
+   For example,
+
+     #define FOO 4
+     x = FOO;
+     #undef FOO
+     x = FOO;
+
+expands into
+
+     x = 4;
+     
+     x = FOO;
+
+In this example, `FOO' had better be a variable or function as well as
+(temporarily) a macro, in order for the result of the expansion to be
+valid C code.
+
+   The same form of `#undef' directive will cancel definitions with
+arguments or definitions that don't expect arguments.  The `#undef'
+directive has no effect when used on a name not currently defined as a
+macro.

+
+Redefining Macros
+-----------------
+
+   "Redefining" a macro means defining (with `#define') a name that is
+already defined as a macro.
+
+   A redefinition is trivial if the new definition is transparently
+identical to the old one.  You probably wouldn't deliberately write a
+trivial redefinition, but they can happen automatically when a header
+file is included more than once (*note Header Files::.), so they are
+accepted silently and without effect.
+
+   Nontrivial redefinition is considered likely to be an error, so it
+provokes a warning message from the preprocessor.  However, sometimes it
+is useful to change the definition of a macro in mid-compilation.  You
+can inhibit the warning by undefining the macro with `#undef' before the
+second definition.
+
+   In order for a redefinition to be trivial, the new definition must
+exactly match the one already in effect, with two possible exceptions:
+
+   * Whitespace may be added or deleted at the beginning or the end.
+
+   * Whitespace may be changed in the middle (but not inside strings).
+     However, it may not be eliminated entirely, and it may not be added
+     where there was no whitespace at all.
+
+   Recall that a comment counts as whitespace.

+Pitfalls and Subtleties of Macros
+---------------------------------
+
+   In this section we describe some special rules that apply to macros
+and macro expansion, and point out certain cases in which the rules have
+counterintuitive consequences that you must watch out for.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Misnesting::        Macros can contain unmatched parentheses.
+* Macro Parentheses:: Why apparently superfluous parentheses
+                         may be necessary to avoid incorrect grouping.
+* Swallow Semicolon:: Macros that look like functions
+                         but expand into compound statements.
+* Side Effects::      Unsafe macros that cause trouble when
+                         arguments contain side effects.
+* Self-Reference::    Macros whose definitions use the macros' own names.
+* Argument Prescan::  Actual arguments are checked for macro calls
+                         before they are substituted.
+* Cascaded Macros::   Macros whose definitions use other macros.
+* Newlines in Args::  Sometimes line numbers get confused.

+
+Improperly Nested Constructs
+............................
+
+   Recall that when a macro is called with arguments, the arguments are
+substituted into the macro body and the result is checked, together with
+the rest of the input file, for more macro calls.
+
+   It is possible to piece together a macro call coming partially from
+the macro body and partially from the actual arguments.  For example,
+
+     #define double(x) (2*(x))
+     #define call_with_1(x) x(1)
+
+would expand `call_with_1 (double)' into `(2*(1))'.
+
+   Macro definitions do not have to have balanced parentheses.  By
+writing an unbalanced open parenthesis in a macro body, it is possible
+to create a macro call that begins inside the macro body but ends
+outside of it.  For example,
+
+     #define strange(file) fprintf (file, "%s %d",
+     ...
+     strange(stderr) p, 35)
+
+This bizarre example expands to `fprintf (stderr, "%s %d", p, 35)'!

+
+Unintended Grouping of Arithmetic
+.................................
+
+   You may have noticed that in most of the macro definition examples
+shown above, each occurrence of a macro argument name had parentheses
+around it.  In addition, another pair of parentheses usually surround
+the entire macro definition.  Here is why it is best to write macros
+that way.
+
+   Suppose you define a macro as follows,
+
+     #define ceil_div(x, y) (x + y - 1) / y
+
+whose purpose is to divide, rounding up.  (One use for this operation is
+to compute how many `int' objects are needed to hold a certain number
+of `char' objects.)  Then suppose it is used as follows:
+
+     a = ceil_div (b & c, sizeof (int));
+
+This expands into
+
+     a = (b & c + sizeof (int) - 1) / sizeof (int);
+
+which does not do what is intended.  The operator-precedence rules of C
+make it equivalent to this:
+
+     a = (b & (c + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
+
+But what we want is this:
+
+     a = ((b & c) + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
+
+Defining the macro as
+
+     #define ceil_div(x, y) ((x) + (y) - 1) / (y)
+
+provides the desired result.
+
+   Unintended grouping can result in another way.  Consider `sizeof
+ceil_div(1, 2)'.  That has the appearance of a C expression that would
+compute the size of the type of `ceil_div (1, 2)', but in fact it means
+something very different.  Here is what it expands to:
+
+     sizeof ((1) + (2) - 1) / (2)
+
+This would take the size of an integer and divide it by two.  The
+precedence rules have put the division outside the `sizeof' when it was
+intended to be inside.
+
+   Parentheses around the entire macro definition can prevent such
+problems.  Here, then, is the recommended way to define `ceil_div':
+
+     #define ceil_div(x, y) (((x) + (y) - 1) / (y))
+

+
+Swallowing the Semicolon
+........................
+
+   Often it is desirable to define a macro that expands into a compound
+statement.  Consider, for example, the following macro, that advances a
+pointer (the argument `p' says where to find it) across whitespace
+characters:
+
+     #define SKIP_SPACES(p, limit)  \
+     { register char *lim = (limit); \
+       while (p != lim) {            \
+         if (*p++ != ' ') {          \
+           p--; break; }}}
+
+Here Backslash-Newline is used to split the macro definition, which must
+be a single line, so that it resembles the way such C code would be
+laid out if not part of a macro definition.
+
+   A call to this macro might be `SKIP_SPACES (p, lim)'.  Strictly
+speaking, the call expands to a compound statement, which is a complete
+statement with no need for a semicolon to end it.  But it looks like a
+function call.  So it minimizes confusion if you can use it like a
+function call, writing a semicolon afterward, as in `SKIP_SPACES (p,
+lim);'
+
+   But this can cause trouble before `else' statements, because the
+semicolon is actually a null statement.  Suppose you write
+
+     if (*p != 0)
+       SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);
+     else ...
+
+The presence of two statements--the compound statement and a null
+statement--in between the `if' condition and the `else' makes invalid C
+code.
+
+   The definition of the macro `SKIP_SPACES' can be altered to solve
+this problem, using a `do ... while' statement.  Here is how:
+
+     #define SKIP_SPACES(p, limit)     \
+     do { register char *lim = (limit); \
+          while (p != lim) {            \
+            if (*p++ != ' ') {          \
+              p--; break; }}}           \
+     while (0)
+
+   Now `SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);' expands into
+
+     do {...} while (0);
+
+which is one statement.

+
+Duplication of Side Effects
+...........................
+
+   Many C programs define a macro `min', for "minimum", like this:
+
+     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
+
+   When you use this macro with an argument containing a side effect,
+as shown here,
+
+     next = min (x + y, foo (z));
+
+it expands as follows:
+
+     next = ((x + y) < (foo (z)) ? (x + y) : (foo (z)));
+
+where `x + y' has been substituted for `X' and `foo (z)' for `Y'.
+
+   The function `foo' is used only once in the statement as it appears
+in the program, but the expression `foo (z)' has been substituted twice
+into the macro expansion.  As a result, `foo' might be called two times
+when the statement is executed.  If it has side effects or if it takes
+a long time to compute, the results might not be what you intended.  We
+say that `min' is an "unsafe" macro.
+
+   The best solution to this problem is to define `min' in a way that
+computes the value of `foo (z)' only once.  The C language offers no
+standard way to do this, but it can be done with GNU C extensions as
+follows:
+
+     #define min(X, Y)                     \
+     ({ typeof (X) __x = (X), __y = (Y);   \
+        (__x < __y) ? __x : __y; })
+
+   If you do not wish to use GNU C extensions, the only solution is to
+be careful when *using* the macro `min'.  For example, you can
+calculate the value of `foo (z)', save it in a variable, and use that
+variable in `min':
+
+     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
+     ...
+     {
+       int tem = foo (z);
+       next = min (x + y, tem);
+     }
+
+(where we assume that `foo' returns type `int').

+
+Self-Referential Macros
+.......................
+
+   A "self-referential" macro is one whose name appears in its
+definition.  A special feature of ANSI Standard C is that the
+self-reference is not considered a macro call.  It is passed into the
+preprocessor output unchanged.
+
+   Let's consider an example:
+
+     #define foo (4 + foo)
+
+where `foo' is also a variable in your program.
+
+   Following the ordinary rules, each reference to `foo' will expand
+into `(4 + foo)'; then this will be rescanned and will expand into `(4
++ (4 + foo))'; and so on until it causes a fatal error (memory full) in
+the preprocessor.
+
+   However, the special rule about self-reference cuts this process
+short after one step, at `(4 + foo)'.  Therefore, this macro definition
+has the possibly useful effect of causing the program to add 4 to the
+value of `foo' wherever `foo' is referred to.
+
+   In most cases, it is a bad idea to take advantage of this feature.  A
+person reading the program who sees that `foo' is a variable will not
+expect that it is a macro as well.  The reader will come across the
+identifier `foo' in the program and think its value should be that of
+the variable `foo', whereas in fact the value is four greater.
+
+   The special rule for self-reference applies also to "indirect"
+self-reference.  This is the case where a macro X expands to use a
+macro `y', and the expansion of `y' refers to the macro `x'.  The
+resulting reference to `x' comes indirectly from the expansion of `x',
+so it is a self-reference and is not further expanded.  Thus, after
+
+     #define x (4 + y)
+     #define y (2 * x)
+
+`x' would expand into `(4 + (2 * x))'.  Clear?
+
+   But suppose `y' is used elsewhere, not from the definition of `x'.
+Then the use of `x' in the expansion of `y' is not a self-reference
+because `x' is not "in progress".  So it does expand.  However, the
+expansion of `x' contains a reference to `y', and that is an indirect
+self-reference now because `y' is "in progress".  The result is that
+`y' expands to `(2 * (4 + y))'.
+
+   It is not clear that this behavior would ever be useful, but it is
+specified by the ANSI C standard, so you may need to understand it.

+
+Separate Expansion of Macro Arguments
+.....................................
+
+   We have explained that the expansion of a macro, including the
+substituted actual arguments, is scanned over again for macro calls to
+be expanded.
+
+   What really happens is more subtle: first each actual argument text
+is scanned separately for macro calls.  Then the results of this are
+substituted into the macro body to produce the macro expansion, and the
+macro expansion is scanned again for macros to expand.
+
+   The result is that the actual arguments are scanned *twice* to expand
+macro calls in them.
+
+   Most of the time, this has no effect.  If the actual argument
+contained any macro calls, they are expanded during the first scan.
+The result therefore contains no macro calls, so the second scan does
+not change it.  If the actual argument were substituted as given, with
+no prescan, the single remaining scan would find the same macro calls
+and produce the same results.
+
+   You might expect the double scan to change the results when a
+self-referential macro is used in an actual argument of another macro
+(*note Self-Reference::.): the self-referential macro would be expanded
+once in the first scan, and a second time in the second scan.  But this
+is not what happens.  The self-references that do not expand in the
+first scan are marked so that they will not expand in the second scan
+either.
+
+   The prescan is not done when an argument is stringified or
+concatenated.  Thus,
+
+     #define str(s) #s
+     #define foo 4
+     str (foo)
+
+expands to `"foo"'.  Once more, prescan has been prevented from having
+any noticeable effect.
+
+   More precisely, stringification and concatenation use the argument as
+written, in un-prescanned form.  The same actual argument would be used
+in prescanned form if it is substituted elsewhere without
+stringification or concatenation.
+
+     #define str(s) #s lose(s)
+     #define foo 4
+     str (foo)
+
+   expands to `"foo" lose(4)'.
+
+   You might now ask, "Why mention the prescan, if it makes no
+difference?  And why not skip it and make the preprocessor faster?"
+The answer is that the prescan does make a difference in three special
+cases:
+
+   * Nested calls to a macro.
+
+   * Macros that call other macros that stringify or concatenate.
+
+   * Macros whose expansions contain unshielded commas.
+
+   We say that "nested" calls to a macro occur when a macro's actual
+argument contains a call to that very macro.  For example, if `f' is a
+macro that expects one argument, `f (f (1))' is a nested pair of calls
+to `f'.  The desired expansion is made by expanding `f (1)' and
+substituting that into the definition of `f'.  The prescan causes the
+expected result to happen.  Without the prescan, `f (1)' itself would
+be substituted as an actual argument, and the inner use of `f' would
+appear during the main scan as an indirect self-reference and would not
+be expanded.  Here, the prescan cancels an undesirable side effect (in
+the medical, not computational, sense of the term) of the special rule
+for self-referential macros.
+
+   But prescan causes trouble in certain other cases of nested macro
+calls.  Here is an example:
+
+     #define foo  a,b
+     #define bar(x) lose(x)
+     #define lose(x) (1 + (x))
+     
+     bar(foo)
+
+We would like `bar(foo)' to turn into `(1 + (foo))', which would then
+turn into `(1 + (a,b))'.  But instead, `bar(foo)' expands into
+`lose(a,b)', and you get an error because `lose' requires a single
+argument.  In this case, the problem is easily solved by the same
+parentheses that ought to be used to prevent misnesting of arithmetic
+operations:
+
+     #define foo (a,b)
+     #define bar(x) lose((x))
+
+   The problem is more serious when the operands of the macro are not
+expressions; for example, when they are statements.  Then parentheses
+are unacceptable because they would make for invalid C code:
+
+     #define foo { int a, b; ... }
+
+In GNU C you can shield the commas using the `({...})' construct which
+turns a compound statement into an expression:
+
+     #define foo ({ int a, b; ... })
+
+   Or you can rewrite the macro definition to avoid such commas:
+
+     #define foo { int a; int b; ... }
+
+   There is also one case where prescan is useful.  It is possible to
+use prescan to expand an argument and then stringify it--if you use two
+levels of macros.  Let's add a new macro `xstr' to the example shown
+above:
+
+     #define xstr(s) str(s)
+     #define str(s) #s
+     #define foo 4
+     xstr (foo)
+
+   This expands into `"4"', not `"foo"'.  The reason for the difference
+is that the argument of `xstr' is expanded at prescan (because `xstr'
+does not specify stringification or concatenation of the argument).
+The result of prescan then forms the actual argument for `str'.  `str'
+uses its argument without prescan because it performs stringification;
+but it cannot prevent or undo the prescanning already done by `xstr'.

+Cascaded Use of Macros
+......................
+
+   A "cascade" of macros is when one macro's body contains a reference
+to another macro.  This is very common practice.  For example,
+
+     #define BUFSIZE 1020
+     #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
+
+   This is not at all the same as defining `TABLESIZE' to be `1020'.
+The `#define' for `TABLESIZE' uses exactly the body you specify--in
+this case, `BUFSIZE'--and does not check to see whether it too is the
+name of a macro.
+
+   It's only when you *use* `TABLESIZE' that the result of its expansion
+is checked for more macro names.
+
+   This makes a difference if you change the definition of `BUFSIZE' at
+some point in the source file.  `TABLESIZE', defined as shown, will
+always expand using the definition of `BUFSIZE' that is currently in
+effect:
+
+     #define BUFSIZE 1020
+     #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
+     #undef BUFSIZE
+     #define BUFSIZE 37
+
+Now `TABLESIZE' expands (in two stages) to `37'.  (The `#undef' is to
+prevent any warning about the nontrivial redefinition of `BUFSIZE'.)

+
+Newlines in Macro Arguments
+---------------------------
+
+   Traditional macro processing carries forward all newlines in macro
+arguments into the expansion of the macro.  This means that, if some of
+the arguments are substituted more than once, or not at all, or out of
+order, newlines can be duplicated, lost, or moved around within the
+expansion.  If the expansion consists of multiple statements, then the
+effect is to distort the line numbers of some of these statements.  The
+result can be incorrect line numbers, in error messages or displayed in
+a debugger.
+
+   The GNU C preprocessor operating in ANSI C mode adjusts appropriately
+for multiple use of an argument--the first use expands all the
+newlines, and subsequent uses of the same argument produce no newlines.
+But even in this mode, it can produce incorrect line numbering if
+arguments are used out of order, or not used at all.
+
+   Here is an example illustrating this problem:
+
+     #define ignore_second_arg(a,b,c) a; c
+     
+     ignore_second_arg (foo (),
+                        ignored (),
+                        syntax error);
+
+The syntax error triggered by the tokens `syntax error' results in an
+error message citing line four, even though the statement text comes
+from line five.

+Conditionals
+============
+
+   In a macro processor, a "conditional" is a directive that allows a
+part of the program to be ignored during compilation, on some
+conditions.  In the C preprocessor, a conditional can test either an
+arithmetic expression or whether a name is defined as a macro.
+
+   A conditional in the C preprocessor resembles in some ways an `if'
+statement in C, but it is important to understand the difference between
+them.  The condition in an `if' statement is tested during the execution
+of your program.  Its purpose is to allow your program to behave
+differently from run to run, depending on the data it is operating on.
+The condition in a preprocessing conditional directive is tested when
+your program is compiled.  Its purpose is to allow different code to be
+included in the program depending on the situation at the time of
+compilation.

+
+Why Conditionals are Used
+-------------------------
+
+   Generally there are three kinds of reason to use a conditional.
+
+   * A program may need to use different code depending on the machine
+     or operating system it is to run on.  In some cases the code for
+     one operating system may be erroneous on another operating system;
+     for example, it might refer to library routines that do not exist
+     on the other system.  When this happens, it is not enough to avoid
+     executing the invalid code: merely having it in the program makes
+     it impossible to link the program and run it.  With a
+     preprocessing conditional, the offending code can be effectively
+     excised from the program when it is not valid.
+
+   * You may want to be able to compile the same source file into two
+     different programs.  Sometimes the difference between the programs
+     is that one makes frequent time-consuming consistency checks on its
+     intermediate data, or prints the values of those data for
+     debugging, while the other does not.
+
+   * A conditional whose condition is always false is a good way to
+     exclude code from the program but keep it as a sort of comment for
+     future reference.
+
+   Most simple programs that are intended to run on only one machine
+will not need to use preprocessing conditionals.

+
+Syntax of Conditionals
+----------------------
+
+   A conditional in the C preprocessor begins with a "conditional
+directive": `#if', `#ifdef' or `#ifndef'.  *Note Conditionals-Macros::,
+for information on `#ifdef' and `#ifndef'; only `#if' is explained here.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* If: #if Directive.     Basic conditionals using `#if' and `#endif'.
+* Else: #else Directive. Including some text if the condition fails.
+* Elif: #elif Directive. Testing several alternative possibilities.
+
+
+File: cpp.info,  Node: #if Directive,  Next: #else Directive,  Up: Conditional Syntax
+
+The `#if' Directive
+...................
+
+   The `#if' directive in its simplest form consists of
+
+     #if EXPRESSION
+     CONTROLLED TEXT
+     #endif /* EXPRESSION */
+
+   The comment following the `#endif' is not required, but it is a good
+practice because it helps people match the `#endif' to the
+corresponding `#if'.  Such comments should always be used, except in
+short conditionals that are not nested.  In fact, you can put anything
+at all after the `#endif' and it will be ignored by the GNU C
+preprocessor, but only comments are acceptable in ANSI Standard C.
+
+   EXPRESSION is a C expression of integer type, subject to stringent
+restrictions.  It may contain
+
+   * Integer constants, which are all regarded as `long' or `unsigned
+     long'.
+
+   * Character constants, which are interpreted according to the
+     character set and conventions of the machine and operating system
+     on which the preprocessor is running.  The GNU C preprocessor uses
+     the C data type `char' for these character constants; therefore,
+     whether some character codes are negative is determined by the C
+     compiler used to compile the preprocessor.  If it treats `char' as
+     signed, then character codes large enough to set the sign bit will
+     be considered negative; otherwise, no character code is considered
+     negative.
+
+   * Arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
+     division, bitwise operations, shifts, comparisons, and logical
+     operations (`&&' and `||').
+
+   * Identifiers that are not macros, which are all treated as zero(!).
+
+   * Macro calls.  All macro calls in the expression are expanded before
+     actual computation of the expression's value begins.
+
+   Note that `sizeof' operators and `enum'-type values are not allowed.
+`enum'-type values, like all other identifiers that are not taken as
+macro calls and expanded, are treated as zero.
+
+   The CONTROLLED TEXT inside of a conditional can include
+preprocessing directives.  Then the directives inside the conditional
+are obeyed only if that branch of the conditional succeeds.  The text
+can also contain other conditional groups.  However, the `#if' and
+`#endif' directives must balance.
+
+
+File: cpp.info,  Node: #else Directive,  Next: #elif Directive,  Prev: #if Directive,  Up: Conditional Syntax
+
+The `#else' Directive
+.....................
+
+   The `#else' directive can be added to a conditional to provide
+alternative text to be used if the condition is false.  This is what it
+looks like:
+
+     #if EXPRESSION
+     TEXT-IF-TRUE
+     #else /* Not EXPRESSION */
+     TEXT-IF-FALSE
+     #endif /* Not EXPRESSION */
+
+   If EXPRESSION is nonzero, and thus the TEXT-IF-TRUE is active, then
+`#else' acts like a failing conditional and the TEXT-IF-FALSE is
+ignored.  Contrariwise, if the `#if' conditional fails, the
+TEXT-IF-FALSE is considered included.
+
+
+File: cpp.info,  Node: #elif Directive,  Prev: #else Directive,  Up: Conditional Syntax
+
+The `#elif' Directive
+.....................
+
+   One common case of nested conditionals is used to check for more
+than two possible alternatives.  For example, you might have
+
+     #if X == 1
+     ...
+     #else /* X != 1 */
+     #if X == 2
+     ...
+     #else /* X != 2 */
+     ...
+     #endif /* X != 2 */
+     #endif /* X != 1 */
+
+   Another conditional directive, `#elif', allows this to be abbreviated
+as follows:
+
+     #if X == 1
+     ...
+     #elif X == 2
+     ...
+     #else /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
+     ...
+     #endif /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
+
+   `#elif' stands for "else if".  Like `#else', it goes in the middle
+of a `#if'-`#endif' pair and subdivides it; it does not require a
+matching `#endif' of its own.  Like `#if', the `#elif' directive
+includes an expression to be tested.
+
+   The text following the `#elif' is processed only if the original
+`#if'-condition failed and the `#elif' condition succeeds.  More than
+one `#elif' can go in the same `#if'-`#endif' group.  Then the text
+after each `#elif' is processed only if the `#elif' condition succeeds
+after the original `#if' and any previous `#elif' directives within it
+have failed.  `#else' is equivalent to `#elif 1', and `#else' is
+allowed after any number of `#elif' directives, but `#elif' may not
+follow `#else'.

+
+Keeping Deleted Code for Future Reference
+-----------------------------------------
+
+   If you replace or delete a part of the program but want to keep the
+old code around as a comment for future reference, the easy way to do
+this is to put `#if 0' before it and `#endif' after it.  This is better
+than using comment delimiters `/*' and `*/' since those won't work if
+the code already contains comments (C comments do not nest).
+
+   This works even if the code being turned off contains conditionals,
+but they must be entire conditionals (balanced `#if' and `#endif').
+
+   Conversely, do not use `#if 0' for comments which are not C code.
+Use the comment delimiters `/*' and `*/' instead.  The interior of `#if
+0' must consist of complete tokens; in particular, singlequote
+characters must balance.  But comments often contain unbalanced
+singlequote characters (known in English as apostrophes).  These
+confuse `#if 0'.  They do not confuse `/*'.
+

+File: cpp.info,  Node: Conditionals-Macros,  Next: Assertions,  Prev: Deleted Code,  Up: Conditionals
+
+Conditionals and Macros
+-----------------------
+
+   Conditionals are useful in connection with macros or assertions,
+because those are the only ways that an expression's value can vary
+from one compilation to another.  A `#if' directive whose expression
+uses no macros or assertions is equivalent to `#if 1' or `#if 0'; you
+might as well determine which one, by computing the value of the
+expression yourself, and then simplify the program.
+
+   For example, here is a conditional that tests the expression
+`BUFSIZE == 1020', where `BUFSIZE' must be a macro.
+
+     #if BUFSIZE == 1020
+       printf ("Large buffers!\n");
+     #endif /* BUFSIZE is large */
+
+   (Programmers often wish they could test the size of a variable or
+data type in `#if', but this does not work.  The preprocessor does not
+understand `sizeof', or typedef names, or even the type keywords such
+as `int'.)
+
+   The special operator `defined' is used in `#if' expressions to test
+whether a certain name is defined as a macro.  Either `defined NAME' or
+`defined (NAME)' is an expression whose value is 1 if NAME is defined
+as macro at the current point in the program, and 0 otherwise.  For the
+`defined' operator it makes no difference what the definition of the
+macro is; all that matters is whether there is a definition.  Thus, for
+example,
+
+     #if defined (vax) || defined (ns16000)
+
+would succeed if either of the names `vax' and `ns16000' is defined as
+a macro.  You can test the same condition using assertions (*note
+Assertions::.), like this:
+
+     #if #cpu (vax) || #cpu (ns16000)
+
+   If a macro is defined and later undefined with `#undef', subsequent
+use of the `defined' operator returns 0, because the name is no longer
+defined.  If the macro is defined again with another `#define',
+`defined' will recommence returning 1.
+
+   Conditionals that test whether just one name is defined are very
+common, so there are two special short conditional directives for this
+case.
+
+`#ifdef NAME'
+     is equivalent to `#if defined (NAME)'.
+
+`#ifndef NAME'
+     is equivalent to `#if ! defined (NAME)'.
+
+   Macro definitions can vary between compilations for several reasons.
+
+   * Some macros are predefined on each kind of machine.  For example,
+     on a Vax, the name `vax' is a predefined macro.  On other
+     machines, it would not be defined.
+
+   * Many more macros are defined by system header files.  Different
+     systems and machines define different macros, or give them
+     different values.  It is useful to test these macros with
+     conditionals to avoid using a system feature on a machine where it
+     is not implemented.
+
+   * Macros are a common way of allowing users to customize a program
+     for different machines or applications.  For example, the macro
+     `BUFSIZE' might be defined in a configuration file for your
+     program that is included as a header file in each source file.  You
+     would use `BUFSIZE' in a preprocessing conditional in order to
+     generate different code depending on the chosen configuration.
+
+   * Macros can be defined or undefined with `-D' and `-U' command
+     options when you compile the program.  You can arrange to compile
+     the same source file into two different programs by choosing a
+     macro name to specify which program you want, writing conditionals
+     to test whether or how this macro is defined, and then controlling
+     the state of the macro with compiler command options.  *Note
+     Invocation::.
+
+   Assertions are usually predefined, but can be defined with
+preprocessor directives or command-line options.

+
+Assertions
+----------
+
+   "Assertions" are a more systematic alternative to macros in writing
+conditionals to test what sort of computer or system the compiled
+program will run on.  Assertions are usually predefined, but you can
+define them with preprocessing directives or command-line options.
+
+   The macros traditionally used to describe the type of target are not
+classified in any way according to which question they answer; they may
+indicate a hardware architecture, a particular hardware model, an
+operating system, a particular version of an operating system, or
+specific configuration options.  These are jumbled together in a single
+namespace.  In contrast, each assertion consists of a named question and
+an answer.  The question is usually called the "predicate".  An
+assertion looks like this:
+
+     #PREDICATE (ANSWER)
+
+You must use a properly formed identifier for PREDICATE.  The value of
+ANSWER can be any sequence of words; all characters are significant
+except for leading and trailing whitespace, and differences in internal
+whitespace sequences are ignored.  Thus, `x + y' is different from
+`x+y' but equivalent to `x + y'.  `)' is not allowed in an answer.
+
+   Here is a conditional to test whether the answer ANSWER is asserted
+for the predicate PREDICATE:
+
+     #if #PREDICATE (ANSWER)
+
+There may be more than one answer asserted for a given predicate.  If
+you omit the answer, you can test whether *any* answer is asserted for
+PREDICATE:
+
+     #if #PREDICATE
+
+   Most of the time, the assertions you test will be predefined
+assertions.  GNU C provides three predefined predicates: `system',
+`cpu', and `machine'.  `system' is for assertions about the type of
+software, `cpu' describes the type of computer architecture, and
+`machine' gives more information about the computer.  For example, on a
+GNU system, the following assertions would be true:
+
+     #system (gnu)
+     #system (mach)
+     #system (mach 3)
+     #system (mach 3.SUBVERSION)
+     #system (hurd)
+     #system (hurd VERSION)
+
+and perhaps others.  The alternatives with more or less version
+information let you ask more or less detailed questions about the type
+of system software.
+
+   On a Unix system, you would find `#system (unix)' and perhaps one of:
+`#system (aix)', `#system (bsd)', `#system (hpux)', `#system (lynx)',
+`#system (mach)', `#system (posix)', `#system (svr3)', `#system
+(svr4)', or `#system (xpg4)' with possible version numbers following.
+
+   Other values for `system' are `#system (mvs)' and `#system (vms)'.
+
+   *Portability note:* Many Unix C compilers provide only one answer
+for the `system' assertion: `#system (unix)', if they support
+assertions at all.  This is less than useful.
+
+   An assertion with a multi-word answer is completely different from
+several assertions with individual single-word answers.  For example,
+the presence of `system (mach 3.0)' does not mean that `system (3.0)'
+is true.  It also does not directly imply `system (mach)', but in GNU
+C, that last will normally be asserted as well.
+
+   The current list of possible assertion values for `cpu' is: `#cpu
+(a29k)', `#cpu (alpha)', `#cpu (arm)', `#cpu (clipper)', `#cpu
+(convex)', `#cpu (elxsi)', `#cpu (tron)', `#cpu (h8300)', `#cpu
+(i370)', `#cpu (i386)', `#cpu (i860)', `#cpu (i960)', `#cpu (m68k)',
+`#cpu (m88k)', `#cpu (mips)', `#cpu (ns32k)', `#cpu (hppa)', `#cpu
+(pyr)', `#cpu (ibm032)', `#cpu (rs6000)', `#cpu (sh)', `#cpu (sparc)',
+`#cpu (spur)', `#cpu (tahoe)', `#cpu (vax)', `#cpu (we32000)'.
+
+   You can create assertions within a C program using `#assert', like
+this:
+
+     #assert PREDICATE (ANSWER)
+
+(Note the absence of a `#' before PREDICATE.)
+
+   Each time you do this, you assert a new true answer for PREDICATE.
+Asserting one answer does not invalidate previously asserted answers;
+they all remain true.  The only way to remove an assertion is with
+`#unassert'.  `#unassert' has the same syntax as `#assert'.  You can
+also remove all assertions about PREDICATE like this:
+
+     #unassert PREDICATE
+
+   You can also add or cancel assertions using command options when you
+run `gcc' or `cpp'.  *Note Invocation::.

+File: cpp.info,  Node: #error Directive,  Prev: Assertions,  Up: Conditionals
+
+The `#error' and `#warning' Directives
+--------------------------------------
+
+   The directive `#error' causes the preprocessor to report a fatal
+error.  The rest of the line that follows `#error' is used as the error
+message.  The line must consist of complete tokens.
+
+   You would use `#error' inside of a conditional that detects a
+combination of parameters which you know the program does not properly
+support.  For example, if you know that the program will not run
+properly on a Vax, you might write
+
+     #ifdef __vax__
+     #error "Won't work on Vaxen.  See comments at get_last_object."
+     #endif
+
+*Note Nonstandard Predefined::, for why this works.
+
+   If you have several configuration parameters that must be set up by
+the installation in a consistent way, you can use conditionals to detect
+an inconsistency and report it with `#error'.  For example,
+
+     #if HASH_TABLE_SIZE % 2 == 0 || HASH_TABLE_SIZE % 3 == 0 \
+         || HASH_TABLE_SIZE % 5 == 0
+     #error HASH_TABLE_SIZE should not be divisible by a small prime
+     #endif
+
+   The directive `#warning' is like the directive `#error', but causes
+the preprocessor to issue a warning and continue preprocessing.  The
+rest of the line that follows `#warning' is used as the warning message.
+
+   You might use `#warning' in obsolete header files, with a message
+directing the user to the header file which should be used instead.

+
+Combining Source Files
+======================
+
+   One of the jobs of the C preprocessor is to inform the C compiler of
+where each line of C code came from: which source file and which line
+number.
+
+   C code can come from multiple source files if you use `#include';
+both `#include' and the use of conditionals and macros can cause the
+line number of a line in the preprocessor output to be different from
+the line's number in the original source file.  You will appreciate the
+value of making both the C compiler (in error messages) and symbolic
+debuggers such as GDB use the line numbers in your source file.
+
+   The C preprocessor builds on this feature by offering a directive by
+which you can control the feature explicitly.  This is useful when a
+file for input to the C preprocessor is the output from another program
+such as the `bison' parser generator, which operates on another file
+that is the true source file.  Parts of the output from `bison' are
+generated from scratch, other parts come from a standard parser file.
+The rest are copied nearly verbatim from the source file, but their
+line numbers in the `bison' output are not the same as their original
+line numbers.  Naturally you would like compiler error messages and
+symbolic debuggers to know the original source file and line number of
+each line in the `bison' input.
+
+   `bison' arranges this by writing `#line' directives into the output
+file.  `#line' is a directive that specifies the original line number
+and source file name for subsequent input in the current preprocessor
+input file.  `#line' has three variants:
+
+`#line LINENUM'
+     Here LINENUM is a decimal integer constant.  This specifies that
+     the line number of the following line of input, in its original
+     source file, was LINENUM.
+
+`#line LINENUM FILENAME'
+     Here LINENUM is a decimal integer constant and FILENAME is a
+     string constant.  This specifies that the following line of input
+     came originally from source file FILENAME and its line number there
+     was LINENUM.  Keep in mind that FILENAME is not just a file name;
+     it is surrounded by doublequote characters so that it looks like a
+     string constant.
+
+`#line ANYTHING ELSE'
+     ANYTHING ELSE is checked for macro calls, which are expanded.  The
+     result should be a decimal integer constant followed optionally by
+     a string constant, as described above.
+
+   `#line' directives alter the results of the `__FILE__' and
+`__LINE__' predefined macros from that point on.  *Note Standard
+Predefined::.
+
+   The output of the preprocessor (which is the input for the rest of
+the compiler) contains directives that look much like `#line'
+directives.  They start with just `#' instead of `#line', but this is
+followed by a line number and file name as in `#line'.  *Note Output::.

+
+Miscellaneous Preprocessing Directives
+======================================
+
+   This section describes three additional preprocessing directives.
+They are not very useful, but are mentioned for completeness.
+
+   The "null directive" consists of a `#' followed by a Newline, with
+only whitespace (including comments) in between.  A null directive is
+understood as a preprocessing directive but has no effect on the
+preprocessor output.  The primary significance of the existence of the
+null directive is that an input line consisting of just a `#' will
+produce no output, rather than a line of output containing just a `#'.
+Supposedly some old C programs contain such lines.
+
+   The ANSI standard specifies that the effect of the `#pragma'
+directive is implementation-defined.  In the GNU C preprocessor,
+`#pragma' directives are not used, except for `#pragma once' (*note
+Once-Only::.).  However, they are left in the preprocessor output, so
+they are available to the compilation pass.
+
+   The `#ident' directive is supported for compatibility with certain
+other systems.  It is followed by a line of text.  On some systems, the
+text is copied into a special place in the object file; on most systems,
+the text is ignored and this directive has no effect.  Typically
+`#ident' is only used in header files supplied with those systems where
+it is meaningful.

+C Preprocessor Output
+=====================
+
+   The output from the C preprocessor looks much like the input, except
+that all preprocessing directive lines have been replaced with blank
+lines and all comments with spaces.  Whitespace within a line is not
+altered; however, unless `-traditional' is used, spaces may be inserted
+into the expansions of macro calls to prevent tokens from being
+concatenated.
+
+   Source file name and line number information is conveyed by lines of
+the form
+
+     # LINENUM FILENAME FLAGS
+
+which are inserted as needed into the middle of the input (but never
+within a string or character constant).  Such a line means that the
+following line originated in file FILENAME at line LINENUM.
+
+   After the file name comes zero or more flags, which are `1', `2',
+`3', or `4'.  If there are multiple flags, spaces separate them.  Here
+is what the flags mean:
+
+`1'
+     This indicates the start of a new file.
+
+`2'
+     This indicates returning to a file (after having included another
+     file).
+
+`3'
+     This indicates that the following text comes from a system header
+     file, so certain warnings should be suppressed.
+
+`4'
+     This indicates that the following text should be treated as C.

+
+Invoking the C Preprocessor
+===========================
+
+   Most often when you use the C preprocessor you will not have to
+invoke it explicitly: the C compiler will do so automatically.
+However, the preprocessor is sometimes useful on its own.
+
+   The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments, INFILE and
+OUTFILE.  The preprocessor reads INFILE together with any other files
+it specifies with `#include'.  All the output generated by the combined
+input files is written in OUTFILE.
+
+   Either INFILE or OUTFILE may be `-', which as INFILE means to read
+from standard input and as OUTFILE means to write to standard output.
+Also, if OUTFILE or both file names are omitted, the standard output
+and standard input are used for the omitted file names.
+
+   Here is a table of command options accepted by the C preprocessor.
+These options can also be given when compiling a C program; they are
+passed along automatically to the preprocessor when it is invoked by the
+compiler.
+
+`-P'
+     Inhibit generation of `#'-lines with line-number information in
+     the output from the preprocessor (*note Output::.).  This might be
+     useful when running the preprocessor on something that is not C
+     code and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
+     `#'-lines.
+
+`-C'
+     Do not discard comments: pass them through to the output file.
+     Comments appearing in arguments of a macro call will be copied to
+     the output before the expansion of the macro call.
+
+`-traditional'
+     Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C, as opposed to ANSI
+     C.
+
+        * Traditional macro expansion pays no attention to singlequote
+          or doublequote characters; macro argument symbols are
+          replaced by the argument values even when they appear within
+          apparent string or character constants.
+
+        * Traditionally, it is permissible for a macro expansion to end
+          in the middle of a string or character constant.  The
+          constant continues into the text surrounding the macro call.
+
+        * However, traditionally the end of the line terminates a
+          string or character constant, with no error.
+
+        * In traditional C, a comment is equivalent to no text at all.
+          (In ANSI C, a comment counts as whitespace.)
+
+        * Traditional C does not have the concept of a "preprocessing
+          number".  It considers `1.0e+4' to be three tokens: `1.0e',
+          `+', and `4'.
+
+        * A macro is not suppressed within its own definition, in
+          traditional C.  Thus, any macro that is used recursively
+          inevitably causes an error.
+
+        * The character `#' has no special meaning within a macro
+          definition in traditional C.
+
+        * In traditional C, the text at the end of a macro expansion
+          can run together with the text after the macro call, to
+          produce a single token.  (This is impossible in ANSI C.)
+
+        * Traditionally, `\' inside a macro argument suppresses the
+          syntactic significance of the following character.
+
+     Use the `-traditional' option when preprocessing Fortran code, so
+     that singlequotes and doublequotes within Fortran comment lines
+     (which are generally not recognized as such by the preprocessor)
+     do not cause diagnostics about unterminated character or string
+     constants.
+
+     However, this option does not prevent diagnostics about
+     unterminated comments when a C-style comment appears to start, but
+     not end, within Fortran-style commentary.
+
+     So, the following Fortran comment lines are accepted with
+     `-traditional':
+
+          C This isn't an unterminated character constant
+          C Neither is "20000000000, an octal constant
+          C in some dialects of Fortran
+
+     However, this type of comment line will likely produce a
+     diagnostic, or at least unexpected output from the preprocessor,
+     due to the unterminated comment:
+
+          C Some Fortran compilers accept /* as starting
+          C an inline comment.
+
+     Note that `g77' automatically supplies the `-traditional' option
+     when it invokes the preprocessor.  However, a future version of
+     `g77' might use a different, more-Fortran-aware preprocessor in
+     place of `cpp'.
+
+`-trigraphs'
+     Process ANSI standard trigraph sequences.  These are
+     three-character sequences, all starting with `??', that are
+     defined by ANSI C to stand for single characters.  For example,
+     `??/' stands for `\', so `'??/n'' is a character constant for a
+     newline.  Strictly speaking, the GNU C preprocessor does not
+     support all programs in ANSI Standard C unless `-trigraphs' is
+     used, but if you ever notice the difference it will be with relief.
+
+     You don't want to know any more about trigraphs.
+
+`-pedantic'
+     Issue warnings required by the ANSI C standard in certain cases
+     such as when text other than a comment follows `#else' or `#endif'.
+
+`-pedantic-errors'
+     Like `-pedantic', except that errors are produced rather than
+     warnings.
+
+`-Wtrigraphs'
+     Warn if any trigraphs are encountered.  Currently this only works
+     if you have turned trigraphs on with `-trigraphs' or `-ansi'; in
+     the future this restriction will be removed.
+
+`-Wcomment'
+     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears in a `/*'
+     comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a `//' comment.
+
+`-Wall'
+     Requests both `-Wtrigraphs' and `-Wcomment' (but not
+     `-Wtraditional' or `-Wundef').
+
+`-Wtraditional'
+     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
+     traditional and ANSI C.
+
+`-Wundef'
+     Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an `#if' directive.
+
+`-I DIRECTORY'
+     Add the directory DIRECTORY to the head of the list of directories
+     to be searched for header files (*note Include Syntax::.).  This
+     can be used to override a system header file, substituting your
+     own version, since these directories are searched before the system
+     header file directories.  If you use more than one `-I' option,
+     the directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard
+     system directories come after.
+
+`-I-'
+     Any directories specified with `-I' options before the `-I-'
+     option are searched only for the case of `#include "FILE"'; they
+     are not searched for `#include <FILE>'.
+
+     If additional directories are specified with `-I' options after
+     the `-I-', these directories are searched for all `#include'
+     directives.
+
+     In addition, the `-I-' option inhibits the use of the current
+     directory as the first search directory for `#include "FILE"'.
+     Therefore, the current directory is searched only if it is
+     requested explicitly with `-I.'.  Specifying both `-I-' and `-I.'
+     allows you to control precisely which directories are searched
+     before the current one and which are searched after.
+
+`-nostdinc'
+     Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
+     Only the directories you have specified with `-I' options (and the
+     current directory, if appropriate) are searched.
+
+`-nostdinc++'
+     Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
+     directories, but do still search the other standard directories.
+     (This option is used when building the C++ library.)
+
+`-remap'
+     When searching for a header file in a directory, remap file names
+     if a file named `header.gcc' exists in that directory.  This can
+     be used to work around limitations of file systems with file name
+     restrictions.  The `header.gcc' file should contain a series of
+     lines with two tokens on each line: the first token is the name to
+     map, and the second token is the actual name to use.
+
+`-D NAME'
+     Predefine NAME as a macro, with definition `1'.
+
+`-D NAME=DEFINITION'
+     Predefine NAME as a macro, with definition DEFINITION.  There are
+     no restrictions on the contents of DEFINITION, but if you are
+     invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you
+     may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters
+     such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.  If you
+     use more than one `-D' for the same NAME, the rightmost definition
+     takes effect.
+
+`-U NAME'
+     Do not predefine NAME.  If both `-U' and `-D' are specified for
+     one name, the `-U' beats the `-D' and the name is not predefined.
+
+`-undef'
+     Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.
+
+`-gcc'
+     Define the macros __GNUC__ and __GNUC_MINOR__.  These are defined
+     automatically when you use `gcc -E'; you can turn them off in that
+     case with `-no-gcc'.
+
+`-A PREDICATE(ANSWER)'
+     Make an assertion with the predicate PREDICATE and answer ANSWER.
+     *Note Assertions::.
+
+     You can use `-A-' to disable all predefined assertions; it also
+     undefines all predefined macros and all macros that preceded it on
+     the command line.
+
+`-dM'
+     Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a list of
+     `#define' directives for all the macros defined during the
+     execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This
+     gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version
+     of the preprocessor; assuming you have no file `foo.h', the command
+
+          touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h
+
+     will show the values of any predefined macros.
+
+`-dD'
+     Like `-dM' except in two respects: it does *not* include the
+     predefined macros, and it outputs *both* the `#define' directives
+     and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to the
+     standard output file.
+
+`-dI'
+     Output `#include' directives in addition to the result of
+     preprocessing.
+
+`-M [-MG]'
+     Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
+     suitable for `make' describing the dependencies of the main source
+     file.  The preprocessor outputs one `make' rule containing the
+     object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of
+     all the included files.  If there are many included files then the
+     rule is split into several lines using `\'-newline.
+
+     `-MG' says to treat missing header files as generated files and
+     assume they live in the same directory as the source file.  It
+     must be specified in addition to `-M'.
+
+     This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
+
+`-MM [-MG]'
+     Like `-M' but mention only the files included with `#include
+     "FILE"'.  System header files included with `#include <FILE>' are
+     omitted.
+
+`-MD FILE'
+     Like `-M' but the dependency information is written to FILE.  This
+     is in addition to compiling the file as specified--`-MD' does not
+     inhibit ordinary compilation the way `-M' does.
+
+     When invoking `gcc', do not specify the FILE argument.  `gcc' will
+     create file names made by replacing ".c" with ".d" at the end of
+     the input file names.
+
+     In Mach, you can use the utility `md' to merge multiple dependency
+     files into a single dependency file suitable for using with the
+     `make' command.
+
+`-MMD FILE'
+     Like `-MD' except mention only user header files, not system
+     header files.
+
+`-H'
+     Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
+     normal activities.
+
+`-imacros FILE'
+     Process FILE as input, discarding the resulting output, before
+     processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated
+     from FILE is discarded, the only effect of `-imacros FILE' is to
+     make the macros defined in FILE available for use in the main
+     input.
+
+`-include FILE'
+     Process FILE as input, and include all the resulting output,
+     before processing the regular input file.
+
+`-idirafter DIR'
+     Add the directory DIR to the second include path.  The directories
+     on the second include path are searched when a header file is not
+     found in any of the directories in the main include path (the one
+     that `-I' adds to).
+
+`-iprefix PREFIX'
+     Specify PREFIX as the prefix for subsequent `-iwithprefix' options.
+
+`-iwithprefix DIR'
+     Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name
+     is made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, where PREFIX was
+     specified previously with `-iprefix'.
+
+`-isystem DIR'
+     Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path,
+     marking it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special
+     treatment as is applied to the standard system directories.
+
+`-x c'
+`-x c++'
+`-x objective-c'
+`-x assembler-with-cpp'
+     Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.
+     This has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions;
+     it merely selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none
+     of these options, cpp will deduce the language from the extension
+     of the source file: `.c', `.cc', `.m', or `.S'.  Some other common
+     extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does
+     not recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is
+     the most generic mode.
+
+     *Note:* Previous versions of cpp accepted a `-lang' option which
+     selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
+     This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the `-l'
+     option.
+
+`-std=STANDARD'
+`-ansi'
+     Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently
+     cpp only knows about the standards for C; other language standards
+     will be added in the future.
+
+     STANDARD may be one of:
+    `iso9899:1990'
+          The ISO C standard from 1990.
+
+    `iso9899:199409'
+    `c89'
+          The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.  `c89' is the
+          customary shorthand for this version of the standard.
+
+          The `-ansi' option is equivalent to `-std=c89'.
+
+    `iso9899:199x'
+    `c9x'
+          The revised ISO C standard, which is expected to be
+          promulgated some time in 1999.  It has not been approved yet,
+          hence the `x'.
+
+    `gnu89'
+          The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.
+
+    `gnu9x'
+          The 199x C standard plus GNU extensions.
+
+`-Wp,-lint'
+     Look for commands to the program checker `lint' embedded in
+     comments, and emit them preceded by `#pragma lint'.  For example,
+     the comment `/* NOTREACHED */' becomes `#pragma lint NOTREACHED'.
+
+     Because of the clash with `-l', you must use the awkward syntax
+     above.  In a future release, this option will be replaced by
+     `-flint' or `-Wlint'; we are not sure which yet.
+
+`-$'
+     Forbid the use of `$' in identifiers.  The C standard does not
+     permit this, but it is a common extension.

+Compile C, C++, Objective C, or Fortran
+***************************************
+
+   The C, C++, and Objective C, and Fortran versions of the compiler are
+integrated; this is why we use the name "GNU Compiler Collection".  GCC
+can compile programs written in C, C++, Objective C, or Fortran.  The
+Fortran compiler is described in a separate manual.
+
+   "GCC" is a common shorthand term for the GNU Compiler Collection.
+This is both the most general name for the compiler, and the name used
+when the emphasis is on compiling C programs (as the abbreviation
+formerly stood for "GNU C Compiler").
+
+   When referring to C++ compilation, it is usual to call the compiler
+"G++".  Since there is only one compiler, it is also accurate to call
+it "GCC" no matter what the language context; however, the term "G++"
+is more useful when the emphasis is on compiling C++ programs.
+
+   We use the name "GCC" to refer to the compilation system as a whole,
+and more specifically to the language-independent part of the compiler.
+For example, we refer to the optimization options as affecting the
+behavior of "GCC" or sometimes just "the compiler".
+
+   Front ends for other languages, such as Ada 9X, Fortran, Modula-3,
+and Pascal, are under development.  These front-ends, like that for
+C++, are built in subdirectories of GCC and link to it.  The result is
+an integrated compiler that can compile programs written in C, C++,
+Objective C, or any of the languages for which you have installed front
+ends.
+
+   In this manual, we only discuss the options for the C, Objective-C,
+and C++ compilers and those of the GCC core.  Consult the documentation
+of the other front ends for the options to use when compiling programs
+written in other languages.
+
+   G++ is a *compiler*, not merely a preprocessor.  G++ builds object
+code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C
+version of the program.  (By contrast, for example, some other
+implementations use a program that generates a C program from your C++
+source.)  Avoiding an intermediate C representation of the program means
+that you get better object code, and better debugging information.  The
+GNU debugger, GDB, works with this information in the object code to
+give you comprehensive C++ source-level editing capabilities (*note C
+and C++: (gdb.info)C.).

+
+GCC Command Options
+*******************
+
+   When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
+assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
+process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the `-c' option says
+not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output
+by the assembler.
+
+   Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
+control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
+options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
+documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
+
+   Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful
+for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
+(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
+for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
+that option with all supported languages.
+
+   *Note Compiling C++ Programs: Invoking G++, for a summary of special
+options for compiling C++ programs.
+
+   The `gcc' program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
+options have multiletter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
+may *not* be grouped: `-dr' is very different from `-d -r'.
+
+   You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
+order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
+options of the same kind; for example, if you specify `-L' more than
+once, the directories are searched in the order specified.
+
+   Many options have long names starting with `-f' or with `-W'--for
+example, `-fforce-mem', `-fstrength-reduce', `-Wformat' and so on.
+Most of these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
+of `-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  This manual documents only one of
+these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Option Summary::	Brief list of all options, without explanations.
+* Overall Options::     Controlling the kind of output:
+                        an executable, object files, assembler files,
+                        or preprocessed source.
+* Invoking G++::	Compiling C++ programs.
+* C Dialect Options::   Controlling the variant of C language compiled.
+* C++ Dialect Options:: Variations on C++.
+* Warning Options::     How picky should the compiler be?
+* Debugging Options::   Symbol tables, measurements, and debugging dumps.
+* Optimize Options::    How much optimization?
+* Preprocessor Options:: Controlling header files and macro definitions.
+                         Also, getting dependency information for Make.
+* Assembler Options::   Passing options to the assembler.
+* Link Options::        Specifying libraries and so on.
+* Directory Options::   Where to find header files and libraries.
+                        Where to find the compiler executable files.
+* Target Options::      Running a cross-compiler, or an old version of GCC.
+* Submodel Options::    Specifying minor hardware or convention variations,
+                        such as 68010 vs 68020.
+* Code Gen Options::    Specifying conventions for function calls, data layout
+                        and register usage.
+* Environment Variables:: Env vars that affect GCC.
+* Running Protoize::    Automatically adding or removing function prototypes.

+
+Options Controlling the Kind of Output
+======================================
+
+   Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
+proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
+stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
+object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
+compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.
+
+   For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind
+of compilation is done:
+
+`FILE.c'
+     C source code which must be preprocessed.
+
+`FILE.i'
+     C source code which should not be preprocessed.
+
+`FILE.ii'
+     C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.
+
+`FILE.m'
+     Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the library
+     `libobjc.a' to make an Objective-C program work.
+
+`FILE.h'
+     C header file (not to be compiled or linked).
+
+`FILE.cc'
+`FILE.cxx'
+`FILE.cpp'
+`FILE.C'
+     C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in `.cxx',
+     the last two letters must both be literally `x'.  Likewise, `.C'
+     refers to a literal capital C.
+
+`FILE.s'
+     Assembler code.
+
+`FILE.S'
+     Assembler code which must be preprocessed.
+
+`OTHER'
+     An object file to be fed straight into linking.  Any file name
+     with no recognized suffix is treated this way.
+
+   You can specify the input language explicitly with the `-x' option:
+
+`-x LANGUAGE'
+     Specify explicitly the LANGUAGE for the following input files
+     (rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the
+     file name suffix).  This option applies to all following input
+     files until the next `-x' option.  Possible values for LANGUAGE
+     are:
+          c  objective-c  c++
+          c-header  cpp-output  c++-cpp-output
+          assembler  assembler-with-cpp
+
+`-x none'
+     Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files
+     are handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if
+     `-x' has not been used at all).
+
+   If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use `-x'
+(or filename suffixes) to tell `gcc' where to start, and one of the
+options `-c', `-S', or `-E' to say where `gcc' is to stop.  Note that
+some combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E' instruct `gcc' to do
+nothing at all.
+
+`-c'
+     Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
+     stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
+     object file for each source file.
+
+     By default, the object file name for a source file is made by
+     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', `.s', etc., with `.o'.
+
+     Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly,
+     are ignored.
+
+`-S'
+     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The
+     output is in the form of an assembler code file for each
+     non-assembler input file specified.
+
+     By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
+     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', etc., with `.s'.
+
+     Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
+
+`-E'
+     Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler
+     proper.  The output is in the form of preprocessed source code,
+     which is sent to the standard output.
+
+     Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.
+
+`-o FILE'
+     Place output in file FILE.  This applies regardless to whatever
+     sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
+     an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
+
+     Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make
+     sense to use `-o' when compiling more than one input file, unless
+     you are producing an executable file as output.
+
+     If `-o' is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
+     in `a.out', the object file for `SOURCE.SUFFIX' in `SOURCE.o', its
+     assembler file in `SOURCE.s', and all preprocessed C source on
+     standard output.
+
+`-v'
+     Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the
+     stages of compilation.  Also print the version number of the
+     compiler driver program and of the preprocessor and the compiler
+     proper.
+
+`-pipe'
+     Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
+     various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems
+     where the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU
+     assembler has no trouble.
+
+`--help'
+     Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line
+     options understood by `gcc'.  If the `-v' option is also specified
+     then `--help' will also be passed on to the various processes
+     invoked by `gcc', so that they can display the command line options
+     they accept.  If the `-W' option is also specified then command
+     line options which have no documentation associated with them will
+     also be displayed.

+
+Compiling C++ Programs
+======================
+
+   C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes `.C', `.cc',
+`.cpp', `.c++', `.cp', or `.cxx'; preprocessed C++ files use the suffix
+`.ii'.  GCC recognizes files with these names and compiles them as C++
+programs even if you call the compiler the same way as for compiling C
+programs (usually with the name `gcc').
+
+   However, C++ programs often require class libraries as well as a
+compiler that understands the C++ language--and under some
+circumstances, you might want to compile programs from standard input,
+or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C++ programs.  `g++'
+is a program that calls GCC with the default language set to C++, and
+automatically specifies linking against the C++ library.  On many
+systems, the script `g++' is also installed with the name `c++'.
+
+   When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
+command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
+language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
+languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.  *Note
+Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options, for explanations of

+
+Options Controlling C Dialect
+=============================
+
+   The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
+from C, such as C++ and Objective C) that the compiler accepts:
+
+`-ansi'
+     In C mode, support all ANSI standard C programs.  In C++ mode,
+     remove GNU extensions that conflict with ANSI C++.
+
+     This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with
+     ANSI C (when compiling C code), or of ANSI standard C++ (when
+     compiling C++ code), such as the `asm' and `typeof' keywords, and
+     predefined macros such as `unix' and `vax' that identify the type
+     of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
+     rarely used ANSI trigraph feature.  For the C compiler, it
+     disables recognition of C++ style `//' comments as well as the
+     `inline' keyword.  For the C++ compiler, `-foperator-names' is
+     enabled as well.
+
+     The alternate keywords `__asm__', `__extension__', `__inline__'
+     and `__typeof__' continue to work despite `-ansi'.  You would not
+     want to use them in an ANSI C program, of course, but it is useful
+     to put them in header files that might be included in compilations
+     done with `-ansi'.  Alternate predefined macros such as `__unix__'
+     and `__vax__' are also available, with or without `-ansi'.
+
+     The `-ansi' option does not cause non-ANSI programs to be rejected
+     gratuitously.  For that, `-pedantic' is required in addition to
+     `-ansi'.  *Note Warning Options::.
+
+     The macro `__STRICT_ANSI__' is predefined when the `-ansi' option
+     is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain from
+     declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
+     ANSI standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with
+     any programs that might use these names for other things.
+
+     The functions `alloca', `abort', `exit', and `_exit' are not
+     builtin functions when `-ansi' is used.
+
+`-flang-isoc9x'
+     Enable support for features found in the C9X standard.  In
+     particular, enable support for the C9X `restrict' keyword.
+
+     Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some C9X
+     features in so far as they do not conflict with previous C
+     standards.  For example, you may use `__restrict__' even when
+     -flang-isoc9x is not specified.
+
+`-fno-asm'
+     Do not recognize `asm', `inline' or `typeof' as a keyword, so that
+     code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use the keywords
+     `__asm__', `__inline__' and `__typeof__' instead.  `-ansi' implies
+     `-fno-asm'.
+
+     In C++, this switch only affects the `typeof' keyword, since `asm'
+     and `inline' are standard keywords.  You may want to use the
+     `-fno-gnu-keywords' flag instead, as it also disables the other,
+     C++-specific, extension keywords such as `headof'.
+
+`-fno-builtin'
+     Don't recognize builtin functions that do not begin with
+     `__builtin_' as prefix.  Currently, the functions affected include
+     `abort', `abs', `alloca', `cos', `exit', `fabs', `ffs', `labs',
+     `memcmp', `memcpy', `sin', `sqrt', `strcmp', `strcpy', and
+     `strlen'.
+
+     GCC normally generates special code to handle certain builtin
+     functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to `alloca' may
+     become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and
+     calls to `memcpy' may become inline copy loops.  The resulting
+     code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function
+     calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on
+     those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by
+     linking with a different library.
+
+     The `-ansi' option prevents `alloca' and `ffs' from being builtin
+     functions, since these functions do not have an ANSI standard
+     meaning.
+
+`-fhosted'
+     Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This
+     implies `-fbuiltin'.  A hosted environment is one in which the
+     entire standard library is available, and in which `main' has a
+     return type of `int'.  Examples are nearly everything except a
+     kernel.  This is equivalent to `-fno-freestanding'.
+
+`-ffreestanding'
+     Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.
+     This implies `-fno-builtin'.  A freestanding environment is one
+     in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup
+     may not necessarily be at `main'.  The most obvious example is an
+     OS kernel.  This is equivalent to `-fno-hosted'.
+
+`-trigraphs'
+     Support ANSI C trigraphs.  You don't want to know about this
+     brain-damage.  The `-ansi' option implies `-trigraphs'.
+
+`-traditional'
+     Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
+     Specifically:
+
+        * All `extern' declarations take effect globally even if they
+          are written inside of a function definition.  This includes
+          implicit declarations of functions.
+
+        * The newer keywords `typeof', `inline', `signed', `const' and
+          `volatile' are not recognized.  (You can still use the
+          alternative keywords such as `__typeof__', `__inline__', and
+          so on.)
+
+        * Comparisons between pointers and integers are always allowed.
+
+        * Integer types `unsigned short' and `unsigned char' promote to
+          `unsigned int'.
+
+        * Out-of-range floating point literals are not an error.
+
+        * Certain constructs which ANSI regards as a single invalid
+          preprocessing number, such as `0xe-0xd', are treated as
+          expressions instead.
+
+        * String "constants" are not necessarily constant; they are
+          stored in writable space, and identical looking constants are
+          allocated separately.  (This is the same as the effect of
+          `-fwritable-strings'.)
+
+        * All automatic variables not declared `register' are preserved
+          by `longjmp'.  Ordinarily, GNU C follows ANSI C: automatic
+          variables not declared `volatile' may be clobbered.
+
+        * The character escape sequences `\x' and `\a' evaluate as the
+          literal characters `x' and `a' respectively.  Without
+          `-traditional', `\x' is a prefix for the hexadecimal
+          representation of a character, and `\a' produces a bell.
+
+     You may wish to use `-fno-builtin' as well as `-traditional' if
+     your program uses names that are normally GNU C builtin functions
+     for other purposes of its own.
+
+     You cannot use `-traditional' if you include any header files that
+     rely on ANSI C features.  Some vendors are starting to ship
+     systems with ANSI C header files and you cannot use `-traditional'
+     on such systems to compile files that include any system headers.
+
+     The `-traditional' option also enables `-traditional-cpp', which
+     is described next.
+
+`-traditional-cpp'
+     Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C preprocessors.
+     Specifically:
+
+        * Comments convert to nothing at all, rather than to a space.
+          This allows traditional token concatenation.
+
+        * In a preprocessing directive, the `#' symbol must appear as
+          the first character of a line.
+
+        * Macro arguments are recognized within string constants in a
+          macro definition (and their values are stringified, though
+          without additional quote marks, when they appear in such a
+          context).  The preprocessor always considers a string
+          constant to end at a newline.
+
+        * The predefined macro `__STDC__' is not defined when you use
+          `-traditional', but `__GNUC__' is (since the GNU extensions
+          which `__GNUC__' indicates are not affected by
+          `-traditional').  If you need to write header files that work
+          differently depending on whether `-traditional' is in use, by
+          testing both of these predefined macros you can distinguish
+          four situations: GNU C, traditional GNU C, other ANSI C
+          compilers, and other old C compilers.  The predefined macro
+          `__STDC_VERSION__' is also not defined when you use
+          `-traditional'.  *Note Standard Predefined Macros:
+          (cpp.info)Standard Predefined, for more discussion of these
+          and other predefined macros.
+
+        * The preprocessor considers a string constant to end at a
+          newline (unless the newline is escaped with `\').  (Without
+          `-traditional', string constants can contain the newline
+          character as typed.)
+
+`-fcond-mismatch'
+     Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second
+     and third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.
+
+`-funsigned-char'
+     Let the type `char' be unsigned, like `unsigned char'.
+
+     Each kind of machine has a default for what `char' should be.  It
+     is either like `unsigned char' by default or like `signed char' by
+     default.
+
+     Ideally, a portable program should always use `signed char' or
+     `unsigned char' when it depends on the signedness of an object.
+     But many programs have been written to use plain `char' and expect
+     it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
+     machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let
+     you make such a program work with the opposite default.
+
+     The type `char' is always a distinct type from each of `signed
+     char' or `unsigned char', even though its behavior is always just
+     like one of those two.
+
+`-fsigned-char'
+     Let the type `char' be signed, like `signed char'.
+
+     Note that this is equivalent to `-fno-unsigned-char', which is the
+     negative form of `-funsigned-char'.  Likewise, the option
+     `-fno-signed-char' is equivalent to `-funsigned-char'.
+
+     You may wish to use `-fno-builtin' as well as `-traditional' if
+     your program uses names that are normally GNU C builtin functions
+     for other purposes of its own.
+
+     You cannot use `-traditional' if you include any header files that
+     rely on ANSI C features.  Some vendors are starting to ship
+     systems with ANSI C header files and you cannot use `-traditional'
+     on such systems to compile files that include any system headers.
+
+`-fsigned-bitfields'
+`-funsigned-bitfields'
+`-fno-signed-bitfields'
+`-fno-unsigned-bitfields'
+     These options control whether a bitfield is signed or unsigned,
+     when the declaration does not use either `signed' or `unsigned'.
+     By default, such a bitfield is signed, because this is consistent:
+     the basic integer types such as `int' are signed types.
+
+     However, when `-traditional' is used, bitfields are all unsigned
+     no matter what.
+
+`-fwritable-strings'
+     Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't
+     uniquize them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which
+     assume they can write into string constants.  The option
+     `-traditional' also has this effect.
+
+     Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; "constants"
+     should be constant.
+
+`-fallow-single-precision'
+     Do not promote single precision math operations to double
+     precision, even when compiling with `-traditional'.
+
+     Traditional K&R C promotes all floating point operations to double
+     precision, regardless of the sizes of the operands.   On the
+     architecture for which you are compiling, single precision may be
+     faster than double precision.   If you must use `-traditional',
+     but want to use single precision operations when the operands are
+     single precision, use this option.   This option has no effect
+     when compiling with ANSI or GNU C conventions (the default).

+
+Arrays of Variable Length
+=========================
+
+   Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in GNU C.  These arrays
+are declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is
+not a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
+declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
+example:
+
+     FILE *
+     concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
+     {
+       char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
+       strcpy (str, s1);
+       strcat (str, s2);
+       return fopen (str, mode);
+     }
+
+   Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates
+the storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
+message for it.
+
+   You can use the function `alloca' to get an effect much like
+variable-length arrays.  The function `alloca' is available in many
+other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
+variable-length arrays are more elegant.
+
+   There are other differences between these two methods.  Space
+allocated with `alloca' exists until the containing *function* returns.
+The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the
+array name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
+`alloca' in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
+will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with `alloca'.)
+
+   You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:
+
+     struct entry
+     tester (int len, char data[len][len])
+     {
+       ...
+     }
+
+   The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
+and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
+`sizeof'.
+
+   If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
+use a forward declaration in the parameter list--another GNU extension.
+
+     struct entry
+     tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
+     {
+       ...
+     }
+
+   The `int len' before the semicolon is a "parameter forward
+declaration", and it serves the purpose of making the name `len' known
+when the declaration of `data' is parsed.
+
+   You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in
+the parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but
+the last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the "real"
+parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a "real"
+declaration in parameter name and data type.

+
+Macros with Variable Numbers of Arguments
+=========================================
+
+   In GNU C, a macro can accept a variable number of arguments, much as
+a function can.  The syntax for defining the macro looks much like that
+used for a function.  Here is an example:
+
+     #define eprintf(format, args...)  \
+      fprintf (stderr, format , ## args)
+
+   Here `args' is a "rest argument": it takes in zero or more
+arguments, as many as the call contains.  All of them plus the commas
+between them form the value of `args', which is substituted into the
+macro body where `args' is used.  Thus, we have this expansion:
+
+     eprintf ("%s:%d: ", input_file_name, line_number)
+     ==>
+     fprintf (stderr, "%s:%d: " , input_file_name, line_number)
+
+Note that the comma after the string constant comes from the definition
+of `eprintf', whereas the last comma comes from the value of `args'.
+
+   The reason for using `##' is to handle the case when `args' matches
+no arguments at all.  In this case, `args' has an empty value.  In this
+case, the second comma in the definition becomes an embarrassment: if
+it got through to the expansion of the macro, we would get something
+like this:
+
+     fprintf (stderr, "success!\n" , )
+
+which is invalid C syntax.  `##' gets rid of the comma, so we get the
+following instead:
+
+     fprintf (stderr, "success!\n")
+
+   This is a special feature of the GNU C preprocessor: `##' before a
+rest argument that is empty discards the preceding sequence of
+non-whitespace characters from the macro definition.  (If another macro
+argument precedes, none of it is discarded.)
+
+   It might be better to discard the last preprocessor token instead of
+the last preceding sequence of non-whitespace characters; in fact, we
+may someday change this feature to do so.  We advise you to write the
+macro definition so that the preceding sequence of non-whitespace
+characters is just a single token, so that the meaning will not change
+if we change the definition of this feature.

+
+Non-Lvalue Arrays May Have Subscripts
+=====================================
+
+   Subscripting is allowed on arrays that are not lvalues, even though
+the unary `&' operator is not.  For example, this is valid in GNU C
+though not valid in other C dialects:
+
+     struct foo {int a[4];};
+     
+     struct foo f();
+     
+     bar (int index)
+     {
+       return f().a[index];
+     }

+
+Arithmetic on `void'- and Function-Pointers
+===========================================
+
+   In GNU C, addition and subtraction operations are supported on
+pointers to `void' and on pointers to functions.  This is done by
+treating the size of a `void' or of a function as 1.
+
+   A consequence of this is that `sizeof' is also allowed on `void' and
+on function types, and returns 1.
+
+   The option `-Wpointer-arith' requests a warning if these extensions
+are used.

+
+Non-Constant Initializers
+=========================
+
+   As in standard C++, the elements of an aggregate initializer for an
+automatic variable are not required to be constant expressions in GNU C.
+Here is an example of an initializer with run-time varying elements:
+
+     foo (float f, float g)
+     {
+       float beat_freqs[2] = { f-g, f+g };
+       ...
+     }
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Constructors,  Next: Labeled Elements,  Prev: Initializers,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Constructor Expressions
+=======================
+
+   GNU C supports constructor expressions.  A constructor looks like a
+cast containing an initializer.  Its value is an object of the type
+specified in the cast, containing the elements specified in the
+initializer.
+
+   Usually, the specified type is a structure.  Assume that `struct
+foo' and `structure' are declared as shown:
+
+     struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;
+
+Here is an example of constructing a `struct foo' with a constructor:
+
+     structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});
+
+This is equivalent to writing the following:
+
+     {
+       struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
+       structure = temp;
+     }
+
+   You can also construct an array.  If all the elements of the
+constructor are (made up of) simple constant expressions, suitable for
+use in initializers, then the constructor is an lvalue and can be
+coerced to a pointer to its first element, as shown here:
+
+     char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };
+
+   Array constructors whose elements are not simple constants are not
+very useful, because the constructor is not an lvalue.  There are only
+two valid ways to use it: to subscript it, or initialize an array
+variable with it.  The former is probably slower than a `switch'
+statement, while the latter does the same thing an ordinary C
+initializer would do.  Here is an example of subscripting an array
+constructor:
+
+     output = ((int[]) { 2, x, 28 }) [input];
+
+   Constructor expressions for scalar types and union types are is also
+allowed, but then the constructor expression is equivalent to a cast.
+

+
+Labeled Elements in Initializers
+================================
+
+   Standard C requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a
+fixed order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or
+structure being initialized.
+
+   In GNU C you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
+indices or structure field names they apply to.  This extension is not
+implemented in GNU C++.
+
+   To specify an array index, write `[INDEX]' or `[INDEX] =' before the
+element value.  For example,
+
+     int a[6] = { [4] 29, [2] = 15 };
+
+is equivalent to
+
+     int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };
+
+The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
+initialized is automatic.
+
+   To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write `[FIRST
+... LAST] = VALUE'.  For example,
+
+     int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 };
+
+Note that the length of the array is the highest value specified plus
+one.
+
+   In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
+with `FIELDNAME:' before the element value.  For example, given the
+following structure,
+
+     struct point { int x, y; };
+
+the following initialization
+
+     struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };
+
+is equivalent to
+
+     struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };
+
+   Another syntax which has the same meaning is `.FIELDNAME ='., as
+shown here:
+
+     struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };
+
+   You can also use an element label (with either the colon syntax or
+the period-equal syntax) when initializing a union, to specify which
+element of the union should be used.  For example,
+
+     union foo { int i; double d; };
+     
+     union foo f = { d: 4 };
+
+will convert 4 to a `double' to store it in the union using the second
+element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type `union foo' would store it
+into the union as the integer `i', since it is an integer.  (*Note Cast
+to Union::.)
+
+   You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
+initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
+does not have a label applies to the next consecutive element of the
+array or structure.  For example,
+
+     int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };
+
+is equivalent to
+
+     int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };
+
+   Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful
+when the indices are characters or belong to an `enum' type.  For
+example:
+
+     int whitespace[256]
+       = { [' '] = 1, ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
+           ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 };
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Case Ranges,  Next: Function Attributes,  Prev: Cast to Union,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Case Ranges
+===========
+
+   You can specify a range of consecutive values in a single `case'
+label, like this:
+
+     case LOW ... HIGH:
+
+This has the same effect as the proper number of individual `case'
+labels, one for each integer value from LOW to HIGH, inclusive.
+
+   This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character
+codes:
+
+     case 'A' ... 'Z':
+
+   *Be careful:* Write spaces around the `...', for otherwise it may be
+parsed wrong when you use it with integer values.  For example, write
+this:
+
+     case 1 ... 5:
+
+rather than this:
+
+     case 1...5:
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Cast to Union,  Next: Case Ranges,  Prev: Labeled Elements,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Cast to a Union Type
+====================
+
+   A cast to union type is similar to other casts, except that the type
+specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with `union
+TAG' or with a typedef name.  A cast to union is actually a constructor
+though, not a cast, and hence does not yield an lvalue like normal
+casts.  (*Note Constructors::.)
+
+   The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
+of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:
+
+     union foo { int i; double d; };
+     int x;
+     double y;
+
+both `x' and `y' can be cast to type `union' foo.
+
+   Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable
+of union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:
+
+     union foo u;
+     ...
+     u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
+     u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y
+
+   You can also use the union cast as a function argument:
+
+     void hack (union foo);
+     ...
+     hack ((union foo) x);

+
+Declaring Attributes of Functions
+=================================
+
+   In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your
+program which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your
+code more carefully.
+
+   The keyword `__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes
+when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an attribute
+specification inside double parentheses.  Nine attributes, `noreturn',
+`const', `format', `no_instrument_function', `section', `constructor',
+`destructor', `unused' and `weak' are currently defined for functions.
+Other attributes, including `section' are supported for variables
+declarations (*note Variable Attributes::.) and for types (*note Type
+Attributes::.).
+
+   You may also specify attributes with `__' preceding and following
+each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
+being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
+you may use `__noreturn__' instead of `noreturn'.
+
+`noreturn'
+     A few standard library functions, such as `abort' and `exit',
+     cannot return.  GNU CC knows this automatically.  Some programs
+     define their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
+     `noreturn' to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,
+
+          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));
+          
+          void
+          fatal (...)
+          {
+            ... /* Print error message. */ ...
+            exit (1);
+          }
+
+     The `noreturn' keyword tells the compiler to assume that `fatal'
+     cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what would
+     happen if `fatal' ever did return.  This makes slightly better
+     code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
+     uninitialized variables.
+
+     Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
+     restored before calling the `noreturn' function.
+
+     It does not make sense for a `noreturn' function to have a return
+     type other than `void'.
+
+     The attribute `noreturn' is not implemented in GNU C versions
+     earlier than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function
+     does not return, which works in the current version and in some
+     older versions, is as follows:
+
+          typedef void voidfn ();
+          
+          volatile voidfn fatal;
+
+`const'
+     Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments,
+     and have no effects except the return value.  Such a function can
+     be subject to common subexpression elimination and loop
+     optimization just as an arithmetic operator would be.  These
+     functions should be declared with the attribute `const'.  For
+     example,
+
+          int square (int) __attribute__ ((const));
+
+     says that the hypothetical function `square' is safe to call fewer
+     times than the program says.
+
+     The attribute `const' is not implemented in GNU C versions earlier
+     than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no
+     side effects, which works in the current version and in some older
+     versions, is as follows:
+
+          typedef int intfn ();
+          
+          extern const intfn square;
+
+     This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the
+     language specifies that the `const' must be attached to the return
+     value.
+
+     Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the
+     data pointed to must *not* be declared `const'.  Likewise, a
+     function that calls a non-`const' function usually must not be
+     `const'.  It does not make sense for a `const' function to return
+     `void'.
+
+`format (ARCHETYPE, STRING-INDEX, FIRST-TO-CHECK)'
+     The `format' attribute specifies that a function takes `printf',
+     `scanf', or `strftime' style arguments which should be type-checked
+     against a format string.  For example, the declaration:
+
+          extern int
+          my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
+                __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
+
+     causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to `my_printf'
+     for consistency with the `printf' style format string argument
+     `my_format'.
+
+     The parameter ARCHETYPE determines how the format string is
+     interpreted, and should be either `printf', `scanf', or
+     `strftime'.  The parameter STRING-INDEX specifies which argument
+     is the format string argument (starting from 1), while
+     FIRST-TO-CHECK is the number of the first argument to check
+     against the format string.  For functions where the arguments are
+     not available to be checked (such as `vprintf'), specify the third
+     parameter as zero.  In this case the compiler only checks the
+     format string for consistency.
+
+     In the example above, the format string (`my_format') is the second
+     argument of the function `my_print', and the arguments to check
+     start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the
+     format attribute are 2 and 3.
+
+     The `format' attribute allows you to identify your own functions
+     which take format strings as arguments, so that GNU CC can check
+     the calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always
+     checks formats for the ANSI library functions `printf', `fprintf',
+     `sprintf', `scanf', `fscanf', `sscanf', `strftime', `vprintf',
+     `vfprintf' and `vsprintf' whenever such warnings are requested
+     (using `-Wformat'), so there is no need to modify the header file
+     `stdio.h'.
+
+`format_arg (STRING-INDEX)'
+     The `format_arg' attribute specifies that a function takes
+     `printf' or `scanf' style arguments, modifies it (for example, to
+     translate it into another language), and passes it to a `printf'
+     or `scanf' style function.  For example, the declaration:
+
+          extern char *
+          my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
+                __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));
+
+     causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to
+     `my_dgettext' whose result is passed to a `printf', `scanf', or
+     `strftime' type function for consistency with the `printf' style
+     format string argument `my_format'.
+
+     The parameter STRING-INDEX specifies which argument is the format
+     string argument (starting from 1).
+
+     The `format-arg' attribute allows you to identify your own
+     functions which modify format strings, so that GNU CC can check the
+     calls to `printf', `scanf', or `strftime' function whose operands
+     are a call to one of your own function.  The compiler always
+     treats `gettext', `dgettext', and `dcgettext' in this manner.
+
+`no_instrument_function'
+     If `-finstrument-functions' is given, profiling function calls will
+     be generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions.
+     Functions with this attribute will not be so instrumented.
+
+`section ("section-name")'
+     Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the `text'
+     section.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you
+     need certain particular functions to appear in special sections.
+     The `section' attribute specifies that a function lives in a
+     particular section.  For example, the declaration:
+
+          extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));
+
+     puts the function `foobar' in the `bar' section.
+
+     Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the
+     `section' attribute is not available on all platforms.  If you
+     need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
+     section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.
+
+`constructor'
+`destructor'
+     The `constructor' attribute causes the function to be called
+     automatically before execution enters `main ()'.  Similarly, the
+     `destructor' attribute causes the function to be called
+     automatically after `main ()' has completed or `exit ()' has been
+     called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
+     initializing data that will be used implicitly during the
+     execution of the program.
+
+     These attributes are not currently implemented for Objective C.
+
+`unused'
+     This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is
+     meant to be possibly unused.  GNU CC will not produce a warning
+     for this function.  GNU C++ does not currently support this
+     attribute as definitions without parameters are valid in C++.
+
+`weak'
+     The `weak' attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
+     symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
+     library functions which can be overridden in user code, though it
+     can also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are
+     supported for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using
+     the GNU assembler and linker.
+
+`alias ("target")'
+     The `alias' attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
+     alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,
+
+          void __f () { /* do something */; }
+          void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));
+
+     declares `f' to be a weak alias for `__f'.  In C++, the mangled
+     name for the target must be used.
+
+     Not all target machines support this attribute.
+
+`no_check_memory_usage'
+     If `-fcheck-memory-usage' is given, calls to support routines will
+     be generated before most memory accesses, to permit support code to
+     record usage and detect uses of uninitialized or unallocated
+     storage.  Since the compiler cannot handle them properly, `asm'
+     statements are not allowed.  Declaring a function with this
+     attribute disables the memory checking code for that function,
+     permitting the use of `asm' statements without requiring separate
+     compilation with different options, and allowing you to write
+     support routines of your own if you wish, without getting infinite
+     recursion if they get compiled with this option.
+
+`regparm (NUMBER)'
+     On the Intel 386, the `regparm' attribute causes the compiler to
+     pass up to NUMBER integer arguments in registers EAX, EDX, and ECX
+     instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a variable number of
+     arguments will continue to be passed all of their arguments on the
+     stack.
+
+`stdcall'
+     On the Intel 386, the `stdcall' attribute causes the compiler to
+     assume that the called function will pop off the stack space used
+     to pass arguments, unless it takes a variable number of arguments.
+
+     The PowerPC compiler for Windows NT currently ignores the `stdcall'
+     attribute.
+
+`cdecl'
+     On the Intel 386, the `cdecl' attribute causes the compiler to
+     assume that the calling function will pop off the stack space used
+     to pass arguments.  This is useful to override the effects of the
+     `-mrtd' switch.
+
+     The PowerPC compiler for Windows NT currently ignores the `cdecl'
+     attribute.
+
+`longcall'
+     On the RS/6000 and PowerPC, the `longcall' attribute causes the
+     compiler to always call the function via a pointer, so that
+     functions which reside further than 64 megabytes (67,108,864
+     bytes) from the current location can be called.
+
+`dllimport'
+     On the PowerPC running Windows NT, the `dllimport' attribute causes
+     the compiler to call the function via a global pointer to the
+     function pointer that is set up by the Windows NT dll library.
+     The pointer name is formed by combining `__imp_' and the function
+     name.
+
+`dllexport'
+     On the PowerPC running Windows NT, the `dllexport' attribute causes
+     the compiler to provide a global pointer to the function pointer,
+     so that it can be called with the `dllimport' attribute.  The
+     pointer name is formed by combining `__imp_' and the function name.
+
+`exception (EXCEPT-FUNC [, EXCEPT-ARG])'
+     On the PowerPC running Windows NT, the `exception' attribute causes
+     the compiler to modify the structured exception table entry it
+     emits for the declared function.  The string or identifier
+     EXCEPT-FUNC is placed in the third entry of the structured
+     exception table.  It represents a function, which is called by the
+     exception handling mechanism if an exception occurs.  If it was
+     specified, the string or identifier EXCEPT-ARG is placed in the
+     fourth entry of the structured exception table.
+
+`function_vector'
+     Use this option on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the
+     specified function should be called through the function vector.
+     Calling a function through the function vector will reduce code
+     size, however; the function vector has a limited size (maximum 128
+     entries on the H8/300 and 64 entries on the H8/300H) and shares
+     space with the interrupt vector.
+
+     You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
+     this option to work correctly.
+
+`interrupt_handler'
+     Use this option on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the
+     specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will
+     generate function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an
+     interrupt handler when this attribute is present.
+
+`eightbit_data'
+     Use this option on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the
+     specified variable should be placed into the eight bit data
+     section.  The compiler will generate more efficient code for
+     certain operations on data in the eight bit data area.  Note the
+     eight bit data area is limited to 256 bytes of data.
+
+     You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
+     this option to work correctly.
+
+`tiny_data'
+     Use this option on the H8/300H to indicate that the specified
+     variable should be placed into the tiny data section.  The
+     compiler will generate more efficient code for loads and stores on
+     data in the tiny data section.  Note the tiny data area is limited
+     to slightly under 32kbytes of data.
+
+`interrupt'
+     Use this option on the M32R/D to indicate that the specified
+     function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will generate
+     function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt
+     handler when this attribute is present.
+
+`model (MODEL-NAME)'
+     Use this attribute on the M32R/D to set the addressability of an
+     object, and the code generated for a function.  The identifier
+     MODEL-NAME is one of `small', `medium', or `large', representing
+     each of the code models.
+
+     Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
+     addresses can be loaded with the `ld24' instruction), and are
+     callable with the `bl' instruction.
+
+     Medium model objects may live anywhere in the 32 bit address space
+     (the compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
+     addresses), and are callable with the `bl' instruction.
+
+     Large model objects may live anywhere in the 32 bit address space
+     (the compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
+     addresses), and may not be reachable with the `bl' instruction
+     (the compiler will generate the much slower `seth/add3/jl'
+     instruction sequence).
+
+   You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by separating
+them by commas within the double parentheses or by immediately
+following an attribute declaration with another attribute declaration.
+
+   Some people object to the `__attribute__' feature, suggesting that
+ANSI C's `#pragma' should be used instead.  There are two reasons for
+not doing this.
+
+  1. It is impossible to generate `#pragma' commands from a macro.
+
+  2. There is no telling what the same `#pragma' might mean in another
+     compiler.
+
+   These two reasons apply to almost any application that might be
+proposed for `#pragma'.  It is basically a mistake to use `#pragma' for
+*anything*.

+
+Prototypes and Old-Style Function Definitions
+=============================================
+
+   GNU C extends ANSI C to allow a function prototype to override a
+later old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following
+example:
+
+     /* Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.  */
+     #ifdef __STDC__
+     #define P(x) x
+     #else
+     #define P(x) ()
+     #endif
+     
+     /* Prototype function declaration.  */
+     int isroot P((uid_t));
+     
+     /* Old-style function definition.  */
+     int
+     isroot (x)   /* ??? lossage here ??? */
+          uid_t x;
+     {
+       return x == 0;
+     }
+
+   Suppose the type `uid_t' happens to be `short'.  ANSI C does not
+allow this example, because subword arguments in old-style
+non-prototype definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the
+function definition's argument is really an `int', which does not match
+the prototype argument type of `short'.
+
+   This restriction of ANSI C makes it hard to write code that is
+portable to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not
+know whether the `uid_t' type is `short', `int', or `long'.  Therefore,
+in cases like these GNU C allows a prototype to override a later
+old-style definition.  More precisely, in GNU C, a function prototype
+argument type overrides the argument type specified by a later
+old-style definition if the former type is the same as the latter type
+before promotion.  Thus in GNU C the above example is equivalent to the
+following:
+
+     int isroot (uid_t);
+     
+     int
+     isroot (uid_t x)
+     {
+       return x == 0;
+     }
+
+   GNU C++ does not support old-style function definitions, so this
+extension is irrelevant.

+C++ Style Comments
+==================
+
+   In GNU C, you may use C++ style comments, which start with `//' and
+continue until the end of the line.  Many other C implementations allow
+such comments, and they are likely to be in a future C standard.
+However, C++ style comments are not recognized if you specify `-ansi'
+or `-traditional', since they are incompatible with traditional
+constructs like `dividend//*comment*/divisor'.

+Dollar Signs in Identifier Names
+================================
+
+   In GNU C, you may normally use dollar signs in identifier names.
+This is because many traditional C implementations allow such
+identifiers.  However, dollar signs in identifiers are not supported on
+a few target machines, typically because the target assembler does not

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Alignment,  Next: Inline,  Prev: Type Attributes,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables
+============================================
+
+   The keyword `__alignof__' allows you to inquire about how an object
+is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
+syntax is just like `sizeof'.
+
+   For example, if the target machine requires a `double' value to be
+aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then `__alignof__ (double)' is 8.  This
+is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine designs,
+`__alignof__ (double)' is 4 or even 2.
+
+   Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference
+to any data type even at an odd addresses.  For these machines,
+`__alignof__' reports the *recommended* alignment of a type.
+
+   When the operand of `__alignof__' is an lvalue rather than a type,
+the value is the largest alignment that the lvalue is known to have.
+It may have this alignment as a result of its data type, or because it
+is part of a structure and inherits alignment from that structure.  For
+example, after this declaration:
+
+     struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
+
+the value of `__alignof__ (foo1.y)' is probably 2 or 4, the same as
+`__alignof__ (int)', even though the data type of `foo1.y' does not
+itself demand any alignment.
+
+   A related feature which lets you specify the alignment of an object
+is `__attribute__ ((aligned (ALIGNMENT)))'; see the following section.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Variable Attributes,  Next: Type Attributes,  Prev: Character Escapes,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Specifying Attributes of Variables
+==================================
+
+   The keyword `__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes
+of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed by an
+attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Eight attributes
+are currently defined for variables: `aligned', `mode', `nocommon',
+`packed', `section', `transparent_union', `unused', and `weak'.  Other
+attributes are available for functions (*note Function Attributes::.)
+and for types (*note Type Attributes::.).
+
+   You may also specify attributes with `__' preceding and following
+each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
+being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
+you may use `__aligned__' instead of `aligned'.
+
+`aligned (ALIGNMENT)'
+     This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
+     structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:
+
+          int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;
+
+     causes the compiler to allocate the global variable `x' on a
+     16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction
+     with an `asm' expression to access the `move16' instruction which
+     requires 16-byte aligned operands.
+
+     You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For
+     example, to create a double-word aligned `int' pair, you could
+     write:
+
+          struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };
+
+     This is an alternative to creating a union with a `double' member
+     that forces the union to be double-word aligned.
+
+     It is not possible to specify the alignment of functions; the
+     alignment of functions is determined by the machine's requirements
+     and cannot be changed.  You cannot specify alignment for a typedef
+     name because such a name is just an alias, not a distinct type.
+
+     As in the preceding examples, you can explicitly specify the
+     alignment (in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given
+     variable or structure field.  Alternatively, you can leave out the
+     alignment factor and just ask the compiler to align a variable or
+     field to the maximum useful alignment for the target machine you
+     are compiling for.  For example, you could write:
+
+          short array[3] __attribute__ ((aligned));
+
+     Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an `aligned'
+     attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the
+     alignment for the declared variable or field to the largest
+     alignment which is ever used for any data type on the target
+     machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often make copy
+     operations more efficient, because the compiler can use whatever
+     instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing
+     copies to or from the variables or fields that you have aligned
+     this way.
+
+     The `aligned' attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
+     can decrease it by specifying `packed' as well.  See below.
+
+     Note that the effectiveness of `aligned' attributes may be limited
+     by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the
+     linker is only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a
+     certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum
+     supported alignment may be very very small.)  If your linker is
+     only able to align variables up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment,
+     then specifying `aligned(16)' in an `__attribute__' will still
+     only provide you with 8 byte alignment.  See your linker
+     documentation for further information.
+
+`mode (MODE)'
+     This attribute specifies the data type for the
+     declaration--whichever type corresponds to the mode MODE.  This in
+     effect lets you request an integer or floating point type
+     according to its width.
+
+     You may also specify a mode of `byte' or `__byte__' to indicate
+     the mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, `word' or `__word__'
+     for the mode of a one-word integer, and `pointer' or `__pointer__'
+     for the mode used to represent pointers.
+
+`nocommon'
+     This attribute specifies requests GNU CC not to place a variable
+     "common" but instead to allocate space for it directly.  If you
+     specify the `-fno-common' flag, GNU CC will do this for all
+     variables.
+
+     Specifying the `nocommon' attribute for a variable provides an
+     initialization of zeros.  A variable may only be initialized in one
+     source file.
+
+`packed'
+     The `packed' attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
+     should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a
+     variable, and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger
+     value with the `aligned' attribute.
+
+     Here is a structure in which the field `x' is packed, so that it
+     immediately follows `a':
+
+          struct foo
+          {
+            char a;
+            int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
+          };
+
+`section ("section-name")'
+     Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections
+     like `data' and `bss'.  Sometimes, however, you need additional
+     sections, or you need certain particular variables to appear in
+     special sections, for example to map to special hardware.  The
+     `section' attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives
+     in a particular section.  For example, this small program uses
+     several specific section names:
+
+          struct duart a __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
+          struct duart b __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
+          char stack[10000] __attribute__ ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
+          int init_data __attribute__ ((section ("INITDATA"))) = 0;
+          
+          main()
+          {
+            /* Initialize stack pointer */
+            init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));
+          
+            /* Initialize initialized data */
+            memcpy (&init_data, &data, &edata - &data);
+          
+            /* Turn on the serial ports */
+            init_duart (&a);
+            init_duart (&b);
+          }
+
+     Use the `section' attribute with an *initialized* definition of a
+     *global* variable, as shown in the example.  GNU CC issues a
+     warning and otherwise ignores the `section' attribute in
+     uninitialized variable declarations.
+
+     You may only use the `section' attribute with a fully initialized
+     global definition because of the way linkers work.  The linker
+     requires each object be defined once, with the exception that
+     uninitialized variables tentatively go in the `common' (or `bss')
+     section and can be multiply "defined".  You can force a variable
+     to be initialized with the `-fno-common' flag or the `nocommon'
+     attribute.
+
+     Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the
+     `section' attribute is not available on all platforms.  If you
+     need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
+     section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.
+
+`transparent_union'
+     This attribute, attached to a function parameter which is a union,
+     means that the corresponding argument may have the type of any
+     union member, but the argument is passed as if its type were that
+     of the first union member.  For more details see *Note Type
+     Attributes::.  You can also use this attribute on a `typedef' for
+     a union data type; then it applies to all function parameters with
+     that type.
+
+`unused'
+     This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable is
+     meant to be possibly unused.  GNU CC will not produce a warning
+     for this variable.
+
+`weak'
+     The `weak' attribute is described in *Note Function Attributes::.
+
+`model (MODEL-NAME)'
+     Use this attribute on the M32R/D to set the addressability of an
+     object.  The identifier MODEL-NAME is one of `small', `medium', or
+     `large', representing each of the code models.
+
+     Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
+     addresses can be loaded with the `ld24' instruction).
+
+     Medium and large model objects may live anywhere in the 32 bit
+     address space (the compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions
+     to load their addresses).
+
+   To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
+double parentheses: for example, `__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
+packed))'.

+
+Specifying Attributes of Types
+==============================
+
+   The keyword `__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes
+of `struct' and `union' types when you define such types.  This keyword
+is followed by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.
+Three attributes are currently defined for types: `aligned', `packed',
+and `transparent_union'.  Other attributes are defined for functions
+(*note Function Attributes::.) and for variables (*note Variable
+Attributes::.).
+
+   You may also specify any one of these attributes with `__' preceding
+and following its keyword.  This allows you to use these attributes in
+header files without being concerned about a possible macro of the same
+name.  For example, you may use `__aligned__' instead of `aligned'.
+
+   You may specify the `aligned' and `transparent_union' attributes
+either in a `typedef' declaration or just past the closing curly brace
+of a complete enum, struct or union type *definition* and the `packed'
+attribute only past the closing brace of a definition.
+
+   You may also specify attributes between the enum, struct or union
+tag and the name of the type rather than after the closing brace.
+
+`aligned (ALIGNMENT)'
+     This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for
+     variables of the specified type.  For example, the declarations:
+
+          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
+          typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
+
+     force the compiler to insure (as far as it can) that each variable
+     whose type is `struct S' or `more_aligned_int' will be allocated
+     and aligned *at least* on a 8-byte boundary.  On a Sparc, having
+     all variables of type `struct S' aligned to 8-byte boundaries
+     allows the compiler to use the `ldd' and `std' (doubleword load and
+     store) instructions when copying one variable of type `struct S' to
+     another, thus improving run-time efficiency.
+
+     Note that the alignment of any given `struct' or `union' type is
+     required by the ANSI C standard to be at least a perfect multiple
+     of the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the
+     members of the `struct' or `union' in question.  This means that
+     you *can* effectively adjust the alignment of a `struct' or `union'
+     type by attaching an `aligned' attribute to any one of the members
+     of such a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above
+     is a more obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the
+     compiler to adjust the alignment of an entire `struct' or `union'
+     type.
+
+     As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the
+     alignment (in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given
+     `struct' or `union' type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the
+     alignment factor and just ask the compiler to align a type to the
+     maximum useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling
+     for.  For example, you could write:
+
+          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned));
+
+     Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an `aligned'
+     attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the
+     alignment for the type to the largest alignment which is ever used
+     for any data type on the target machine you are compiling for.
+     Doing this can often make copy operations more efficient, because
+     the compiler can use whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks
+     of memory when performing copies to or from the variables which
+     have types that you have aligned this way.
+
+     In the example above, if the size of each `short' is 2 bytes, then
+     the size of the entire `struct S' type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
+     power of two which is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
+     compiler sets the alignment for the entire `struct S' type to 8
+     bytes.
+
+     Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a
+     time-efficient alignment for a given type and then declare only
+     individual stand-alone objects of that type, the compiler's
+     ability to select a time-efficient alignment is primarily useful
+     only when you plan to create arrays of variables having the
+     relevant (efficiently aligned) type.  If you declare or use arrays
+     of variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then it is likely
+     that your program will also be doing pointer arithmetic (or
+     subscripting, which amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the
+     relevant type, and the code that the compiler generates for these
+     pointer arithmetic operations will often be more efficient for
+     efficiently-aligned types than for other types.
+
+     The `aligned' attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
+     can decrease it by specifying `packed' as well.  See below.
+
+     Note that the effectiveness of `aligned' attributes may be limited
+     by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the
+     linker is only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a
+     certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum
+     supported alignment may be very very small.)  If your linker is
+     only able to align variables up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment,
+     then specifying `aligned(16)' in an `__attribute__' will still
+     only provide you with 8 byte alignment.  See your linker
+     documentation for further information.
+
+`packed'
+     This attribute, attached to an `enum', `struct', or `union' type
+     definition, specified that the minimum required memory be used to
+     represent the type.
+
+     Specifying this attribute for `struct' and `union' types is
+     equivalent to specifying the `packed' attribute on each of the
+     structure or union members.  Specifying the `-fshort-enums' flag
+     on the line is equivalent to specifying the `packed' attribute on
+     all `enum' definitions.
+
+     You may only specify this attribute after a closing curly brace on
+     an `enum' definition, not in a `typedef' declaration, unless that
+     declaration also contains the definition of the `enum'.
+
+`transparent_union'
+     This attribute, attached to a `union' type definition, indicates
+     that any function parameter having that union type causes calls to
+     that function to be treated in a special way.
+
+     First, the argument corresponding to a transparent union type can
+     be of any type in the union; no cast is required.  Also, if the
+     union contains a pointer type, the corresponding argument can be a
+     null pointer constant or a void pointer expression; and if the
+     union contains a void pointer type, the corresponding argument can
+     be any pointer expression.  If the union member type is a pointer,
+     qualifiers like `const' on the referenced type must be respected,
+     just as with normal pointer conversions.
+
+     Second, the argument is passed to the function using the calling
+     conventions of first member of the transparent union, not the
+     calling conventions of the union itself.  All members of the union
+     must have the same machine representation; this is necessary for
+     this argument passing to work properly.
+
+     Transparent unions are designed for library functions that have
+     multiple interfaces for compatibility reasons.  For example,
+     suppose the `wait' function must accept either a value of type
+     `int *' to comply with Posix, or a value of type `union wait *' to
+     comply with the 4.1BSD interface.  If `wait''s parameter were
+     `void *', `wait' would accept both kinds of arguments, but it
+     would also accept any other pointer type and this would make
+     argument type checking less useful.  Instead, `<sys/wait.h>' might
+     define the interface as follows:
+
+          typedef union
+            {
+              int *__ip;
+              union wait *__up;
+            } wait_status_ptr_t __attribute__ ((__transparent_union__));
+          
+          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t);
+
+     This interface allows either `int *' or `union wait *' arguments
+     to be passed, using the `int *' calling convention.  The program
+     can call `wait' with arguments of either type:
+
+          int w1 () { int w; return wait (&w); }
+          int w2 () { union wait w; return wait (&w); }
+
+     With this interface, `wait''s implementation might look like this:
+
+          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t p)
+          {
+            return waitpid (-1, p.__ip, 0);
+          }
+
+`unused'
+     When attached to a type (including a `union' or a `struct'), this
+     attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
+     possibly unused.  GNU CC will not produce a warning for any
+     variables of that type, even if the variable appears to do
+     nothing.  This is often the case with lock or thread classes,
+     which are usually defined and then not referenced, but contain
+     constructors and destructors that have nontrivial bookkeeping
+     functions.
+
+   To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
+double parentheses: for example, `__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
+packed))'.

+
+An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro
+========================================
+
+   By declaring a function `inline', you can direct GNU CC to integrate
+that function's code into the code for its callers.  This makes
+execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
+addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their known
+values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not all of the
+inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on code size is
+less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller with function
+inlining, depending on the particular case.  Inlining of functions is an
+optimization and it really "works" only in optimizing compilation.  If
+you don't use `-O', no function is really inline.
+
+   To declare a function inline, use the `inline' keyword in its
+declaration, like this:
+
+     inline int
+     inc (int *a)
+     {
+       (*a)++;
+     }
+
+   (If you are writing a header file to be included in ANSI C programs,
+write `__inline__' instead of `inline'.  *Note Alternate Keywords::.)
+You can also make all "simple enough" functions inline with the option
+`-finline-functions'.
+
+   Note that certain usages in a function definition can make it
+unsuitable for inline substitution.  Among these usages are: use of
+varargs, use of alloca, use of variable sized data types (*note
+Variable Length::.), use of computed goto (*note Labels as Values::.),
+use of nonlocal goto, and nested functions (*note Nested Functions::.).
+Using `-Winline' will warn when a function marked `inline' could not
+be substituted, and will give the reason for the failure.
+
+   Note that in C and Objective C, unlike C++, the `inline' keyword
+does not affect the linkage of the function.
+
+   GNU CC automatically inlines member functions defined within the
+class body of C++ programs even if they are not explicitly declared
+`inline'.  (You can override this with `-fno-default-inline'; *note
+Options Controlling C++ Dialect: C++ Dialect Options..)
+
+   When a function is both inline and `static', if all calls to the
+function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
+never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced.
+In this case, GNU CC does not actually output assembler code for the
+function, unless you specify the option `-fkeep-inline-functions'.
+Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
+calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
+neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
+nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
+usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
+refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.
+
+   When an inline function is not `static', then the compiler must
+assume that there may be calls from other source files; since a global
+symbol can be defined only once in any program, the function must not
+be defined in the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be
+integrated.  Therefore, a non-`static' inline function is always
+compiled on its own in the usual fashion.
+
+   If you specify both `inline' and `extern' in the function
+definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
+is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
+address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
+if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.
+
+   This combination of `inline' and `extern' has almost the effect of a
+macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in a header
+file with these keywords, and put another copy of the definition
+(lacking `inline' and `extern') in a library file.  The definition in
+the header file will cause most calls to the function to be inlined.
+If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to the single copy
+in the library.
+
+   GNU C does not inline any functions when not optimizing.  It is not
+clear whether it is better to inline or not, in this case, but we found
+that a correct implementation when not optimizing was difficult.  So we
+did the easy thing, and turned it off.

+
+Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands
+=================================================
+
+   In an assembler instruction using `asm', you can specify the
+operands of the instruction using C expressions.  This means you need
+not guess which registers or memory locations will contain the data you
+want to use.
+
+   You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what
+appears in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for
+each operand.
+
+   For example, here is how to use the 68881's `fsinx' instruction:
+
+     asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
+
+Here `angle' is the C expression for the input operand while `result'
+is that of the output operand.  Each has `"f"' as its operand
+constraint, saying that a floating point register is required.  The `='
+in `=f' indicates that the operand is an output; all output operands'
+constraints must use `='.  The constraints use the same language used
+in the machine description (*note Constraints::.).
+
+   Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by
+the C expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler
+template from the first output operand and another separates the last
+output operand from the first input, if any.  Commas separate the
+operands within each group.  The total number of operands is limited to
+ten or to the maximum number of operands in any instruction pattern in
+the machine description, whichever is greater.
+
+   If there are no output operands but there are input operands, you
+must place two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output
+operands would go.
+
+   Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check
+this.  The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot
+check whether the operands have data types that are reasonable for the
+instruction being executed.  It does not parse the assembler instruction
+template and does not know what it means or even whether it is valid
+assembler input.  The extended `asm' feature is most often used for
+machine instructions the compiler itself does not know exist.  If the
+output expression cannot be directly addressed (for example, it is a
+bit field), your constraint must allow a register.  In that case, GNU CC
+will use the register as the output of the `asm', and then store that
+register into the output.
+
+   The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GNU CC will assume
+that the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and
+need not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write
+operands.  Use the constraint character `+' to indicate such an operand
+and list it with the output operands.
+
+   When the constraints for the read-write operand (or the operand in
+which only some of the bits are to be changed) allows a register, you
+may, as an alternative, logically split its function into two separate
+operands, one input operand and one write-only output operand.  The
+connection between them is expressed by constraints which say they need
+to be in the same location when the instruction executes.  You can use
+the same C expression for both operands, or different expressions.  For
+example, here we write the (fictitious) `combine' instruction with
+`bar' as its read-only source operand and `foo' as its read-write
+destination:
+
+     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
+
+The constraint `"0"' for operand 1 says that it must occupy the same
+location as operand 0.  A digit in constraint is allowed only in an
+input operand and it must refer to an output operand.
+
+   Only a digit in the constraint can guarantee that one operand will
+be in the same place as another.  The mere fact that `foo' is the value
+of both operands is not enough to guarantee that they will be in the
+same place in the generated assembler code.  The following would not
+work reliably:
+
+     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));
+
+   Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to
+be in different registers; GNU CC knows no reason not to do so.  For
+example, the compiler might find a copy of the value of `foo' in one
+register and use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in
+a different register (copying it afterward to `foo''s own address).  Of
+course, since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the
+assembler code, the result will not work, but GNU CC can't tell that.
+
+   Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe this,
+write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the names of
+the clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a realistic
+example for the VAX:
+
+     asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
+                   : /* no outputs */
+                   : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
+                   : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");
+
+   It is an error for a clobber description to overlap an input or
+output operand (for example, an operand describing a register class
+with one member, mentioned in the clobber list).  Most notably, it is
+invalid to describe that an input operand is modified, but unused as
+output.  It has to be specified as an input and output operand anyway.
+Note that if there are only unused output operands, you will then also
+need to specify `volatile' for the `asm' construct, as described below.
+
+   If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler
+code, you will probably have to list the register after the third colon
+to tell the compiler the register's value is modified.  In some
+assemblers, the register names begin with `%'; to produce one `%' in the
+assembler code, you must write `%%' in the input.
+
+   If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register,
+add `cc' to the list of clobbered registers.  GNU CC on some machines
+represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register; `cc'
+serves to name this register.  On other machines, the condition code is
+handled differently, and specifying `cc' has no effect.  But it is
+valid no matter what the machine.
+
+   If your assembler instruction modifies memory in an unpredictable
+fashion, add `memory' to the list of clobbered registers.  This will
+cause GNU CC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the
+assembler instruction.
+
+   You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single
+`asm' template, separated either with newlines (written as `\n') or
+with semicolons if the assembler allows such semicolons.  The GNU
+assembler allows semicolons and most Unix assemblers seem to do so.
+The input operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered
+registers, and neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can
+read and write the clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here
+is an example of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes the
+subroutine `_foo' accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:
+
+     asm ("movl %0,r9;movl %1,r10;call _foo"
+          : /* no outputs */
+          : "g" (from), "g" (to)
+          : "r9", "r10");
+
+   Unless an output operand has the `&' constraint modifier, GNU CC may
+allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on the
+assumption the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced.
+This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
+more than one instruction.  In such a case, use `&' for each output
+operand that may not overlap an input.  *Note Modifiers::.
+
+   If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler
+instruction, you must include a branch and a label in the `asm'
+construct, as follows:
+
+     asm ("clr %0;frob %1;beq 0f;mov #1,%0;0:"
+          : "g" (result)
+          : "g" (input));
+
+This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
+and most Unix assemblers do.
+
+   Speaking of labels, jumps from one `asm' to another are not
+supported.  The compiler's optimizers do not know about these jumps, and
+therefore they cannot take account of them when deciding how to
+optimize.
+
+   Usually the most convenient way to use these `asm' instructions is to
+encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,
+
+     #define sin(x)       \
+     ({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
+        asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
+        __value; })
+
+Here the variable `__arg' is used to make sure that the instruction
+operates on a proper `double' value, and to accept only those arguments
+`x' which can convert automatically to a `double'.
+
+   Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct data
+type is to use a cast in the `asm'.  This is different from using a
+variable `__arg' in that it converts more different types.  For
+example, if the desired type were `int', casting the argument to `int'
+would accept a pointer with no complaint, while assigning the argument
+to an `int' variable named `__arg' would warn about using a pointer
+unless the caller explicitly casts it.
+
+   If an `asm' has output operands, GNU CC assumes for optimization
+purposes the instruction has no side effects except to change the output
+operands.  This does not mean instructions with a side effect cannot be
+used, but you must be careful, because the compiler may eliminate them
+if the output operands aren't used, or move them out of loops, or
+replace two with one if they constitute a common subexpression.  Also,
+if your instruction does have a side effect on a variable that otherwise
+appears not to change, the old value of the variable may be reused later
+if it happens to be found in a register.
+
+   You can prevent an `asm' instruction from being deleted, moved
+significantly, or combined, by writing the keyword `volatile' after the
+`asm'.  For example:
+
+     #define get_and_set_priority(new)  \
+     ({ int __old; \
+        asm volatile ("get_and_set_priority %0, %1": "=g" (__old) : "g" (new)); \
+        __old; })
+
+If you write an `asm' instruction with no outputs, GNU CC will know the
+instruction has side-effects and will not delete the instruction or
+move it outside of loops.  If the side-effects of your instruction are
+not purely external, but will affect variables in your program in ways
+other than reading the inputs and clobbering the specified registers or
+memory, you should write the `volatile' keyword to prevent future
+versions of GNU CC from moving the instruction around within a core
+region.
+
+   An `asm' instruction without any operands or clobbers (and "old
+style" `asm') will not be deleted or moved significantly, regardless,
+unless it is unreachable, the same wasy as if you had written a
+`volatile' keyword.
+
+   Note that even a volatile `asm' instruction can be moved in ways
+that appear insignificant to the compiler, such as across jump
+instructions.  You can't expect a sequence of volatile `asm'
+instructions to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive
+output, use a single `asm'.
+
+   It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the
+condition code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we
+attempted to implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.
+The problem is that output operands might need reloading, which would
+result in additional following "store" instructions.  On most machines,
+these instructions would alter the condition code before there was time
+to test it.  This problem doesn't arise for ordinary "test" and
+"compare" instructions because they don't have any output operands.
+
+   If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ANSI C
+programs, write `__asm__' instead of `asm'.  *Note Alternate Keywords::.
+
+i386 floating point asm operands
+--------------------------------
+
+   There are several rules on the usage of stack-like regs in
+asm_operands insns.  These rules apply only to the operands that are
+stack-like regs:
+
+  1. Given a set of input regs that die in an asm_operands, it is
+     necessary to know which are implicitly popped by the asm, and
+     which must be explicitly popped by gcc.
+
+     An input reg that is implicitly popped by the asm must be
+     explicitly clobbered, unless it is constrained to match an output
+     operand.
+
+  2. For any input reg that is implicitly popped by an asm, it is
+     necessary to know how to adjust the stack to compensate for the
+     pop.  If any non-popped input is closer to the top of the
+     reg-stack than the implicitly popped reg, it would not be possible
+     to know what the stack looked like -- it's not clear how the rest
+     of the stack "slides up".
+
+     All implicitly popped input regs must be closer to the top of the
+     reg-stack than any input that is not implicitly popped.
+
+     It is possible that if an input dies in an insn, reload might use
+     the input reg for an output reload.  Consider this example:
+
+          asm ("foo" : "=t" (a) : "f" (b));
+
+     This asm says that input B is not popped by the asm, and that the
+     asm pushes a result onto the reg-stack, ie, the stack is one
+     deeper after the asm than it was before.  But, it is possible that
+     reload will think that it can use the same reg for both the input
+     and the output, if input B dies in this insn.
+
+     If any input operand uses the `f' constraint, all output reg
+     constraints must use the `&' earlyclobber.
+
+     The asm above would be written as
+
+          asm ("foo" : "=&t" (a) : "f" (b));
+
+  3. Some operands need to be in particular places on the stack.  All
+     output operands fall in this category -- there is no other way to
+     know which regs the outputs appear in unless the user indicates
+     this in the constraints.
+
+     Output operands must specifically indicate which reg an output
+     appears in after an asm.  `=f' is not allowed: the operand
+     constraints must select a class with a single reg.
+
+  4. Output operands may not be "inserted" between existing stack regs.
+     Since no 387 opcode uses a read/write operand, all output operands
+     are dead before the asm_operands, and are pushed by the
+     asm_operands.  It makes no sense to push anywhere but the top of
+     the reg-stack.
+
+     Output operands must start at the top of the reg-stack: output
+     operands may not "skip" a reg.
+
+  5. Some asm statements may need extra stack space for internal
+     calculations.  This can be guaranteed by clobbering stack registers
+     unrelated to the inputs and outputs.
+
+
+   Here are a couple of reasonable asms to want to write.  This asm
+takes one input, which is internally popped, and produces two outputs.
+
+     asm ("fsincos" : "=t" (cos), "=u" (sin) : "0" (inp));
+
+   This asm takes two inputs, which are popped by the `fyl2xp1' opcode,
+and replaces them with one output.  The user must code the `st(1)'
+clobber for reg-stack.c to know that `fyl2xp1' pops both inputs.
+
+     asm ("fyl2xp1" : "=t" (result) : "0" (x), "u" (y) : "st(1)");

+
+Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code
+========================================
+
+   You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
+function or variable by writing the `asm' (or `__asm__') keyword after
+the declarator as follows:
+
+     int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
+
+This specifies that the name to be used for the variable `foo' in the
+assembler code should be `myfoo' rather than the usual `_foo'.
+
+   On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of
+a C function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for
+the linker that do not start with an underscore.
+
+   You cannot use `asm' in this way in a function *definition*; but you
+can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
+before its definition and putting `asm' there, like this:
+
+     extern func () asm ("FUNC");
+     
+     func (x, y)
+          int x, y;
+     ...
+
+   It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do
+not conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
+register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.
+GNU CC does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in
+registers.  Perhaps that will be added.

+
+Variables in Specified Registers
+================================
+
+   GNU C allows you to put a few global variables into specified
+hardware registers.  You can also specify the register in which an
+ordinary register variable should be allocated.
+
+   * Global register variables reserve registers throughout the program.
+     This may be useful in programs such as programming language
+     interpreters which have a couple of global variables that are
+     accessed very often.
+
+   * Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
+     registers.  The compiler's data flow analysis is capable of
+     determining where the specified registers contain live values, and
+     where they are available for other uses.  Stores into local
+     register variables may be deleted when they appear to be dead
+     according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register
+     variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.
+
+     These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the
+     extended `asm' feature (*note Extended Asm::.), if you want to
+     write one output of the assembler instruction directly into a
+     particular register.  (This will work provided the register you
+     specify fits the constraints specified for that operand in the
+     `asm'.)

+
+Defining Global Register Variables
+----------------------------------
+
+   You can define a global register variable in GNU C like this:
+
+     register int *foo asm ("a5");
+
+Here `a5' is the name of the register which should be used.  Choose a
+register which is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
+machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.
+
+   Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, so you would need to
+conditionalize your program according to cpu type.  The register `a5'
+would be a good choice on a 68000 for a variable of pointer type.  On
+machines with register windows, be sure to choose a "global" register
+that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.
+
+   In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how
+they name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.
+For example, some 68000 operating systems call this register `%a5'.
+
+   Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a
+register automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should
+choose and how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is
+evident.
+
+   Defining a global register variable in a certain register reserves
+that register entirely for this use, at least within the current
+compilation.  The register will not be allocated for any other purpose
+in the functions in the current compilation.  The register will not be
+saved and restored by these functions.  Stores into this register are
+never deleted even if they would appear to be dead, but references may
+be deleted or moved or simplified.
+
+   It is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
+handlers, or from more than one thread of control, because the system
+library routines may temporarily use the register for other things
+(unless you recompile them specially for the task at hand).
+
+   It is not safe for one function that uses a global register variable
+to call another such function `foo' by way of a third function `lose'
+that was compiled without knowledge of this variable (i.e. in a
+different source file in which the variable wasn't declared).  This is
+because `lose' might save the register and put some other value there.
+For example, you can't expect a global register variable to be
+available in the comparison-function that you pass to `qsort', since
+`qsort' might have put something else in that register.  (If you are
+prepared to recompile `qsort' with the same global register variable,
+you can solve this problem.)
+
+   If you want to recompile `qsort' or other source files which do not
+actually use your global register variable, so that they will not use
+that register for any other purpose, then it suffices to specify the
+compiler option `-ffixed-REG'.  You need not actually add a global
+register declaration to their source code.
+
+   A function which can alter the value of a global register variable
+cannot safely be called from a function compiled without this variable,
+because it could clobber the value the caller expects to find there on
+return.  Therefore, the function which is the entry point into the part
+of the program that uses the global register variable must explicitly
+save and restore the value which belongs to its caller.
+
+   On most machines, `longjmp' will restore to each global register
+variable the value it had at the time of the `setjmp'.  On some
+machines, however, `longjmp' will not change the value of global
+register variables.  To be portable, the function that called `setjmp'
+should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
+variables, and to restore them in a `longjmp'.  This way, the same
+thing will happen regardless of what `longjmp' does.
+
+   All global register variable declarations must precede all function
+definitions.  If such a declaration could appear after function
+definitions, the declaration would be too late to prevent the register
+from being used for other purposes in the preceding functions.
+
+   Global register variables may not have initial values, because an
+executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.
+
+   On the Sparc, there are reports that g3 ... g7 are suitable
+registers, but certain library functions, such as `getwd', as well as
+the subroutines for division and remainder, modify g3 and g4.  g1 and
+g2 are local temporaries.
+
+   On the 68000, a2 ... a5 should be suitable, as should d2 ... d7.  Of
+course, it will not do to use more than a few of those.
+

+
+Specifying Registers for Local Variables
+----------------------------------------
+
+   You can define a local register variable with a specified register
+like this:
+
+     register int *foo asm ("a5");
+
+Here `a5' is the name of the register which should be used.  Note that
+this is the same syntax used for defining global register variables,
+but for a local variable it would appear within a function.
+
+   Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
+problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
+assembler instructions (*note Extended Asm::.).  Both of these things
+generally require that you conditionalize your program according to cpu
+type.
+
+   In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how
+they name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.
+For example, some 68000 operating systems call this register `%a5'.
+
+   Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
+remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
+the variable's value is not live.  However, these registers are made
+unavailable for use in the reload pass; excessive use of this feature
+leaves the compiler too few available registers to compile certain
+functions.
+
+   This option does not guarantee that GNU CC will generate code that
+has this variable in the register you specify at all times.  You may not
+code an explicit reference to this register in an `asm' statement and
+assume it will always refer to this variable.
+
+   Stores into local register variables may be deleted when they appear
+to be dead according to dataflow analysis.  References to local
+register variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Alternate Keywords,  Next: Incomplete Enums,  Prev: Explicit Reg Vars,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Alternate Keywords
+==================
+
+   The option `-traditional' disables certain keywords; `-ansi'
+disables certain others.  This causes trouble when you want to use GNU C
+extensions, or ANSI C features, in a general-purpose header file that
+should be usable by all programs, including ANSI C programs and
+traditional ones.  The keywords `asm', `typeof' and `inline' cannot be
+used since they won't work in a program compiled with `-ansi', while
+the keywords `const', `volatile', `signed', `typeof' and `inline' won't
+work in a program compiled with `-traditional'.
+
+   The way to solve these problems is to put `__' at the beginning and
+end of each problematical keyword.  For example, use `__asm__' instead
+of `asm', `__const__' instead of `const', and `__inline__' instead of
+`inline'.
+
+   Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you
+want to compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate
+keywords as macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It
+looks like this:
+
+     #ifndef __GNUC__
+     #define __asm__ asm
+     #endif
+
+   `-pedantic' causes warnings for many GNU C extensions.  You can
+prevent such warnings within one expression by writing `__extension__'
+before the expression.  `__extension__' has no effect aside from this.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Incomplete Enums,  Next: Function Names,  Prev: Alternate Keywords,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Incomplete `enum' Types
+=======================
+
+   You can define an `enum' tag without specifying its possible values.
+This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
+`struct foo' without describing the elements.  A later declaration
+which does specify the possible values completes the type.
+
+   You can't allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
+incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.
+
+   This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of
+`enum' more consistent with the way `struct' and `union' are handled.
+
+   This extension is not supported by GNU C++.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Function Names,  Next: Return Address,  Prev: Incomplete Enums,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Function Names as Strings
+=========================
+
+   GNU CC predefines two string variables to be the name of the current
+function.  The variable `__FUNCTION__' is the name of the function as
+it appears in the source.  The variable `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__' is the
+name of the function pretty printed in a language specific fashion.
+
+   These names are always the same in a C function, but in a C++
+function they may be different.  For example, this program:
+
+     extern "C" {
+     extern int printf (char *, ...);
+     }
+     
+     class a {
+      public:
+       sub (int i)
+         {
+           printf ("__FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
+           printf ("__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
+         }
+     };
+     
+     int
+     main (void)
+     {
+       a ax;
+       ax.sub (0);
+       return 0;
+     }
+
+gives this output:
+
+     __FUNCTION__ = sub
+     __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = int  a::sub (int)
+
+   These names are not macros: they are predefined string variables.
+For example, `#ifdef __FUNCTION__' does not have any special meaning
+inside a function, since the preprocessor does not do anything special
+with the identifier `__FUNCTION__'.

+
+Getting the Return or Frame Address of a Function
+=================================================
+
+   These functions may be used to get information about the callers of a
+function.
+
+`__builtin_return_address (LEVEL)'
+     This function returns the return address of the current function,
+     or of one of its callers.  The LEVEL argument is number of frames
+     to scan up the call stack.  A value of `0' yields the return
+     address of the current function, a value of `1' yields the return
+     address of the caller of the current function, and so forth.
+
+     The LEVEL argument must be a constant integer.
+
+     On some machines it may be impossible to determine the return
+     address of any function other than the current one; in such cases,
+     or when the top of the stack has been reached, this function will
+     return `0'.
+
+     This function should only be used with a non-zero argument for
+     debugging purposes.
+
+`__builtin_frame_address (LEVEL)'
+     This function is similar to `__builtin_return_address', but it
+     returns the address of the function frame rather than the return
+     address of the function.  Calling `__builtin_frame_address' with a
+     value of `0' yields the frame address of the current function, a
+     value of `1' yields the frame address of the caller of the current
+     function, and so forth.
+
+     The frame is the area on the stack which holds local variables and
+     saved registers.  The frame address is normally the address of the
+     first word pushed on to the stack by the function.  However, the
+     exact definition depends upon the processor and the calling
+     convention.  If the processor has a dedicated frame pointer
+     register, and the function has a frame, then
+     `__builtin_frame_address' will return the value of the frame
+     pointer register.
+
+     The caveats that apply to `__builtin_return_address' apply to this
+     function as well.

+
+Other built-in functions provided by GNU CC
+===========================================
+
+   GNU CC provides a large number of built-in functions other than the
+ones mentioned above.  Some of these are for internal use in the
+processing of exceptions or variable-length argument lists and will not
+be documented here because they may change from time to time; we do not
+recommend general use of these functions.
+
+   The remaining functions are provided for optimization purposes.
+
+   GNU CC includes builtin versions of many of the functions in the
+standard C library.  These will always be treated as having the same
+meaning as the C library function even if you specify the
+`-fno-builtin' (*note C Dialect Options::.) option.  These functions
+correspond to the C library functions `alloca', `ffs', `abs', `fabsf',
+`fabs', `fabsl', `labs', `memcpy', `memcmp', `strcmp', `strcpy',
+`strlen', `sqrtf', `sqrt', `sqrtl', `sinf', `sin', `sinl', `cosf',
+`cos', and `cosl'.
+
+   You can use the builtin function `__builtin_constant_p' to determine
+if a value is known to be constant at compile-time and hence that GNU
+CC can perform constant-folding on expressions involving that value.
+The argument of the function is the value to test.  The function
+returns the integer 1 if the argument is known to be a compile-time
+constant and 0 if it is not known to be a compile-time constant.  A
+return of 0 does not indicate that the value is *not* a constant, but
+merely that GNU CC cannot prove it is a constant with the specified
+value of the `-O' option.
+
+   You would typically use this function in an embedded application
+where memory was a critical resource.  If you have some complex
+calculation, you may want it to be folded if it involves constants, but
+need to call a function if it does not.  For example:
+
+     #define Scale_Value(X)  \
+       (__builtin_constant_p (X) ? ((X) * SCALE + OFFSET) : Scale (X))
+
+   You may use this builtin function in either a macro or an inline
+function.  However, if you use it in an inlined function and pass an
+argument of the function as the argument to the builtin, GNU CC will
+never return 1 when you call the inline function with a string constant
+or constructor expression (*note Constructors::.) and will not return 1
+when you pass a constant numeric value to the inline function unless you
+specify the `-O' option.

+
+Deprecated Features
+===================
+
+   In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
+features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving. Now that
+the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superceded by
+superior alternatives. Using the old features might cause a warning in
+some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future. In other
+cases, the feature might be gone already.
+
+   While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the
+options that are now deprecated:
+
+`-fthis-is-variable'
+     In early versions of C++, assignment to this could be used to
+     implement application-defined memory allocation. Now, allocation
+     functions (`operator new') are the standard-conforming way to
+     achieve the same effect.
+
+`-fexternal-templates'
+`-falt-external-templates'
+     These are two of the many ways for g++ to implement template
+     instantiation. *Note Template Instantiation::. The C++ standard
+     clearly defines how template definitions have to be organized
+     across implementation units. g++ has an implicit instantiation
+     mechanism that should work just fine for standard-conforming code.

+   You can use this feature to avoid an extra constructor call when a
+function result has a class type.  For example, consider a function
+`m', declared as `X v = m ();', whose result is of class `X':
+
+     X
+     m ()
+     {
+       X b;
+       b.a = 23;
+       return b;
+     }
+
+   Although `m' appears to have no arguments, in fact it has one
+implicit argument: the address of the return value.  At invocation, the
+address of enough space to hold `v' is sent in as the implicit argument.
+Then `b' is constructed and its `a' field is set to the value 23.
+Finally, a copy constructor (a constructor of the form `X(X&)') is
+applied to `b', with the (implicit) return value location as the
+target, so that `v' is now bound to the return value.
+
+   But this is wasteful.  The local `b' is declared just to hold
+something that will be copied right out.  While a compiler that
+combined an "elision" algorithm with interprocedural data flow analysis
+could conceivably eliminate all of this, it is much more practical to
+allow you to assist the compiler in generating efficient code by
+manipulating the return value explicitly, thus avoiding the local
+variable and copy constructor altogether.
+
+   Using the extended GNU C++ function-definition syntax, you can avoid
+the temporary allocation and copying by naming `r' as your return value
+at the outset, and assigning to its `a' field directly:
+
+     X
+     m () return r;
+     {
+       r.a = 23;
+     }
+
+The declaration of `r' is a standard, proper declaration, whose effects
+are executed *before* any of the body of `m'.
+
+   Functions of this type impose no additional restrictions; in
+particular, you can execute `return' statements, or return implicitly by
+reaching the end of the function body ("falling off the edge").  Cases
+like
+
+     X
+     m () return r (23);
+     {
+       return;
+     }
+
+(or even `X m () return r (23); { }') are unambiguous, since the return
+value `r' has been initialized in either case.  The following code may
+be hard to read, but also works predictably:
+
+     X
+     m () return r;
+     {
+       X b;
+       return b;
+     }
+
+   The return value slot denoted by `r' is initialized at the outset,
+but the statement `return b;' overrides this value.  The compiler deals
+with this by destroying `r' (calling the destructor if there is one, or
+doing nothing if there is not), and then reinitializing `r' with `b'.
+
+   This extension is provided primarily to help people who use
+overloaded operators, where there is a great need to control not just
+the arguments, but the return values of functions.  For classes where
+the copy constructor incurs a heavy performance penalty (especially in
+the common case where there is a quick default constructor), this is a
+major savings.  The disadvantage of this extension is that you do not
+control when the default constructor for the return value is called: it
+is always called at the beginning.

+
+Minimum and Maximum Operators in C++
+====================================
+
+   It is very convenient to have operators which return the "minimum"
+or the "maximum" of two arguments.  In GNU C++ (but not in GNU C),
+
+`A <? B'
+     is the "minimum", returning the smaller of the numeric values A
+     and B;
+
+`A >? B'
+     is the "maximum", returning the larger of the numeric values A and
+     B.
+
+   These operations are not primitive in ordinary C++, since you can
+use a macro to return the minimum of two things in C++, as in the
+following example.
+
+     #define MIN(X,Y) ((X) < (Y) ? : (X) : (Y))
+
+You might then use `int min = MIN (i, j);' to set MIN to the minimum
+value of variables I and J.
+
+   However, side effects in `X' or `Y' may cause unintended behavior.
+For example, `MIN (i++, j++)' will fail, incrementing the smaller
+counter twice.  A GNU C extension allows you to write safe macros that
+avoid this kind of problem (*note Naming an Expression's Type: Naming
+Types.).  However, writing `MIN' and `MAX' as macros also forces you to
+use function-call notation for a fundamental arithmetic operation.
+Using GNU C++ extensions, you can write `int min = i <? j;' instead.
+
+   Since `<?' and `>?' are built into the compiler, they properly
+handle expressions with side-effects;  `int min = i++ <? j++;' works
+correctly.

+`goto' and Destructors in GNU C++
+=================================
+
+   In C++ programs, you can safely use the `goto' statement.  When you
+use it to exit a block which contains aggregates requiring destructors,
+the destructors will run before the `goto' transfers control.
+
+   The compiler still forbids using `goto' to *enter* a scope that
+requires constructors.

+
+Declarations and Definitions in One Header
+==========================================
+
+   C++ object definitions can be quite complex.  In principle, your
+source code will need two kinds of things for each object that you use
+across more than one source file.  First, you need an "interface"
+specification, describing its structure with type declarations and
+function prototypes.  Second, you need the "implementation" itself.  It
+can be tedious to maintain a separate interface description in a header
+file, in parallel to the actual implementation.  It is also dangerous,
+since separate interface and implementation definitions may not remain
+parallel.
+
+   With GNU C++, you can use a single header file for both purposes.
+
+     *Warning:* The mechanism to specify this is in transition.  For the
+     nonce, you must use one of two `#pragma' commands; in a future
+     release of GNU C++, an alternative mechanism will make these
+     `#pragma' commands unnecessary.
+
+   The header file contains the full definitions, but is marked with
+`#pragma interface' in the source code.  This allows the compiler to
+use the header file only as an interface specification when ordinary
+source files incorporate it with `#include'.  In the single source file
+where the full implementation belongs, you can use either a naming
+convention or `#pragma implementation' to indicate this alternate use
+of the header file.
+
+`#pragma interface'
+`#pragma interface "SUBDIR/OBJECTS.h"'
+     Use this directive in *header files* that define object classes,
+     to save space in most of the object files that use those classes.
+     Normally, local copies of certain information (backup copies of
+     inline member functions, debugging information, and the internal
+     tables that implement virtual functions) must be kept in each
+     object file that includes class definitions.  You can use this
+     pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a header file containing
+     `#pragma interface' is included in a compilation, this auxiliary
+     information will not be generated (unless the main input source
+     file itself uses `#pragma implementation').  Instead, the object
+     files will contain references to be resolved at link time.
+
+     The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you
+     have multiple headers with the same name in different directories.
+     If you use this form, you must specify the same string to `#pragma
+     implementation'.
+
+`#pragma implementation'
+`#pragma implementation "OBJECTS.h"'
+     Use this pragma in a *main input file*, when you want full output
+     from included header files to be generated (and made globally
+     visible).  The included header file, in turn, should use `#pragma
+     interface'.  Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging
+     information, and the internal tables used to implement virtual
+     functions are all generated in implementation files.
+
+     If you use `#pragma implementation' with no argument, it applies to
+     an include file with the same basename(1) as your source file.
+     For example, in `allclass.cc', giving just `#pragma implementation'
+     by itself is equivalent to `#pragma implementation "allclass.h"'.
+
+     In versions of GNU C++ prior to 2.6.0 `allclass.h' was treated as
+     an implementation file whenever you would include it from
+     `allclass.cc' even if you never specified `#pragma
+     implementation'.  This was deemed to be more trouble than it was
+     worth, however, and disabled.
+
+     If you use an explicit `#pragma implementation', it must appear in
+     your source file *before* you include the affected header files.
+
+     Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
+     include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
+     `#include' to include the header file; `#pragma implementation'
+     only specifies how to use the file--it doesn't actually include
+     it.)
+
+     There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file
+     into multiple implementation files.
+
+   `#pragma implementation' and `#pragma interface' also have an effect
+on function inlining.
+
+   If you define a class in a header file marked with `#pragma
+interface', the effect on a function defined in that class is similar to
+an explicit `extern' declaration--the compiler emits no code at all to
+define an independent version of the function.  Its definition is used
+only for inlining with its callers.
+
+   Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source
+file that declares it as `#pragma implementation', the compiler emits
+code for the function itself; this defines a version of the function
+that can be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without
+inlining).  If all calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid
+emitting the function by compiling with `-fno-implement-inlines'.  If
+any calls were not inlined, you will get linker errors.

+
+Where's the Template?
+=====================
+
+   C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
+intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
+system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
+template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
+and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
+problem, which I will refer to as the Borland model and the Cfront
+model.
+
+Borland model
+     Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding
+     the code equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler
+     emits template instances in each translation unit that uses them,
+     and the linker collapses them together.  The advantage of this
+     model is that the linker only has to consider the object files
+     themselves; there is no external complexity to worry about.  This
+     disadvantage is that compilation time is increased because the
+     template code is being compiled repeatedly.  Code written for this
+     model tends to include definitions of all templates in the header
+     file, since they must be seen to be instantiated.
+
+Cfront model
+     The AT&T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
+     problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
+     automatically maintained place where template instances are
+     stored.  A more modern version of the repository works as follows:
+     As individual object files are built, the compiler places any
+     template definitions and instantiations encountered in the
+     repository.  At link time, the link wrapper adds in the objects in
+     the repository and compiles any needed instances that were not
+     previously emitted.  The advantages of this model are more optimal
+     compilation speed and the ability to use the system linker; to
+     implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also needs to
+     replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly increased
+     complexity, and thus potential for error; for some code this can be
+     just as transparent, but in practice it can been very difficult to
+     build multiple programs in one directory and one program in
+     multiple directories.  Code written for this model tends to
+     separate definitions of non-inline member templates into a
+     separate file, which should be compiled separately.
+
+   When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
+Linux/GNU or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, g++ supports the
+Borland model.  On other systems, g++ implements neither automatic
+model.
+
+   A future version of g++ will support a hybrid model whereby the
+compiler will emit any instantiations for which the template definition
+is included in the compile, and store template definitions and
+instantiation context information into the object file for the rest.
+The link wrapper will extract that information as necessary and invoke
+the compiler to produce the remaining instantiations.  The linker will
+then combine duplicate instantiations.
+
+   In the mean time, you have the following options for dealing with
+template instantiations:
+
+  1. Compile your template-using code with `-frepo'.  The compiler will
+     generate files with the extension `.rpo' listing all of the
+     template instantiations used in the corresponding object files
+     which could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, `collect2',
+     will then update the `.rpo' files to tell the compiler where to
+     place those instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.
+     The link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the
+     compiler will continue to place the instantiations in the same
+     files.
+
+     This is your best option for application code written for the
+     Borland model, as it will just work.  Code written for the Cfront
+     model will need to be modified so that the template definitions
+     are available at one or more points of instantiation; usually this
+     is as simple as adding `#include <tmethods.cc>' to the end of each
+     template header.
+
+     For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the
+     template instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its
+     object files together; the link will fail, but cause the
+     instantiations to be generated as a side effect.  Be warned,
+     however, that this may cause conflicts if multiple libraries try
+     to provide the same instantiations.  For greater control, use
+     explicit instantiation as described in the next option.
+
+  2. Compile your code with `-fno-implicit-templates' to disable the
+     implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly
+     instantiate all the ones you use.  This approach requires more
+     knowledge of exactly which instances you need than do the others,
+     but it's less mysterious and allows greater control.  You can
+     scatter the explicit instantiations throughout your program,
+     perhaps putting them in the translation units where the instances
+     are used or the translation units that define the templates
+     themselves; you can put all of the explicit instantiations you
+     need into one big file; or you can create small files like
+
+          #include "Foo.h"
+          #include "Foo.cc"
+          
+          template class Foo<int>;
+          template ostream& operator <<
+                          (ostream&, const Foo<int>&);
+
+     for each of the instances you need, and create a template
+     instantiation library from those.
+
+     If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with
+     not using `-fno-implicit-templates' when compiling files that don't
+     `#include' the member template definitions.
+
+     If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
+     compile it without `-fno-implicit-templates' so you get all of the
+     instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
+     other files) without having to specify them as well.
+
+     g++ has extended the template instantiation syntax outlined in the
+     Working Paper to allow forward declaration of explicit
+     instantiations and instantiation of the compiler support data for
+     a template class (i.e. the vtable) without instantiating any of
+     its members:
+
+          extern template int max (int, int);
+          inline template class Foo<int>;
+
+  3. Do nothing.  Pretend g++ does implement automatic instantiation
+     management.  Code written for the Borland model will work fine, but
+     each translation unit will contain instances of each of the
+     templates it uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an
+     unacceptable amount of code duplication.
+
+  4. Add `#pragma interface' to all files containing template
+     definitions.  For each of these files, add `#pragma implementation
+     "FILENAME"' to the top of some `.C' file which `#include's it.
+     Then compile everything with `-fexternal-templates'.  The
+     templates will then only be expanded in the translation unit which
+     implements them (i.e. has a `#pragma implementation' line for the
+     file where they live); all other files will use external
+     references.  If you're lucky, everything should work properly.  If
+     you get undefined symbol errors, you need to make sure that each
+     template instance which is used in the program is used in the file
+     which implements that template.  If you don't have any use for a
+     particular instance in that file, you can just instantiate it
+     explicitly, using the syntax from the latest C++ working paper:
+
+          template class A<int>;
+          template ostream& operator << (ostream&, const A<int>&);
+
+     This strategy will work with code written for either model.  If
+     you are using code written for the Cfront model, the file
+     containing a class template and the file containing its member
+     templates should be implemented in the same translation unit.
+
+     A slight variation on this approach is to instead use the flag
+     `-falt-external-templates'; this flag causes template instances to
+     be emitted in the translation unit that implements the header
+     where they are first instantiated, rather than the one which
+     implements the file where the templates are defined.  This header
+     must be the same in all translation units, or things are likely to
+     break.
+
+     *Note Declarations and Definitions in One Header: C++ Interface,
+     for more discussion of these pragmas.

+Extracting the function pointer from a bound pointer to member function
+=======================================================================
+
+   In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a
+wide pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the
+PMF needs to store information about how to adjust the `this' pointer,
+and if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
+where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
+PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
+that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
+would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
+the inner loop, to save a bit of time.
+
+   Note that you will still be paying the penalty for the call through a
+function pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the
+branch prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal
+virtual function calls.
+
+   The syntax for this extension is
+
+     extern A a;
+     extern int (A::*fp)();
+     typedef int (*fptr)(A *);
+     
+     fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);

+
+Type Abstraction using Signatures
+=================================
+
+   In GNU C++, you can use the keyword `signature' to define a
+completely abstract class interface as a datatype.  You can connect this
+abstraction with actual classes using signature pointers.  If you want
+to use signatures, run the GNU compiler with the `-fhandle-signatures'
+command-line option.  (With this option, the compiler reserves a second
+keyword `sigof' as well, for a future extension.)
+
+   Roughly, signatures are type abstractions or interfaces of classes.
+Some other languages have similar facilities.  C++ signatures are
+related to ML's signatures, Haskell's type classes, definition modules
+in Modula-2, interface modules in Modula-3, abstract types in Emerald,
+type modules in Trellis/Owl, categories in Scratchpad II, and types in
+POOL-I.  For a more detailed discussion of signatures, see `Signatures:
+A Language Extension for Improving Type Abstraction and Subtype
+Polymorphism in C++' by Gerald Baumgartner and Vincent F. Russo (Tech
+report CSD-TR-95-051, Dept. of Computer Sciences, Purdue University,
+August 1995, a slightly improved version appeared in
+*Software--Practice & Experience*, 25(8), pp. 863-889, August 1995).
+You can get the tech report by anonymous FTP from `ftp.cs.purdue.edu'
+in `pub/gb/Signature-design.ps.gz'.
+
+   Syntactically, a signature declaration is a collection of member
+function declarations and nested type declarations.  For example, this
+signature declaration defines a new abstract type `S' with member
+functions `int foo ()' and `int bar (int)':
+
+     signature S
+     {
+       int foo ();
+       int bar (int);
+     };
+
+   Since signature types do not include implementation definitions, you
+cannot write an instance of a signature directly.  Instead, you can
+define a pointer to any class that contains the required interfaces as a
+"signature pointer".  Such a class "implements" the signature type.
+
+   To use a class as an implementation of `S', you must ensure that the
+class has public member functions `int foo ()' and `int bar (int)'.
+The class can have other member functions as well, public or not; as
+long as it offers what's declared in the signature, it is suitable as
+an implementation of that signature type.
+
+   For example, suppose that `C' is a class that meets the requirements
+of signature `S' (`C' "conforms to" `S').  Then
+
+     C obj;
+     S * p = &obj;
+
+defines a signature pointer `p' and initializes it to point to an
+object of type `C'.  The member function call `int i = p->foo ();'
+executes `obj.foo ()'.
+
+   Abstract virtual classes provide somewhat similar facilities in
+standard C++.  There are two main advantages to using signatures
+instead:
+
+  1. Subtyping becomes independent from inheritance.  A class or
+     signature type `T' is a subtype of a signature type `S'
+     independent of any inheritance hierarchy as long as all the member
+     functions declared in `S' are also found in `T'.  So you can
+     define a subtype hierarchy that is completely independent from any
+     inheritance (implementation) hierarchy, instead of being forced to
+     use types that mirror the class inheritance hierarchy.
+
+  2. Signatures allow you to work with existing class hierarchies as
+     implementations of a signature type.  If those class hierarchies
+     are only available in compiled form, you're out of luck with
+     abstract virtual classes, since an abstract virtual class cannot
+     be retrofitted on top of existing class hierarchies.  So you would
+     be required to write interface classes as subtypes of the abstract
+     virtual class.
+
+   There is one more detail about signatures.  A signature declaration
+can contain member function *definitions* as well as member function
+declarations.  A signature member function with a full definition is
+called a *default implementation*; classes need not contain that
+particular interface in order to conform.  For example, a class `C' can
+conform to the signature
+
+     signature T
+     {
+       int f (int);
+       int f0 () { return f (0); };
+     };
+
+whether or not `C' implements the member function `int f0 ()'.  If you
+define `C::f0', that definition takes precedence; otherwise, the
+default implementation `S::f0' applies.

+Introduction to `gcov'
+======================
+
+   `gcov' is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GNU CC to
+analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running
+code.  You can use `gcov' as a profiling tool to help discover where
+your optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also use
+`gcov' along with the other profiling tool, `gprof', to assess which
+parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time.
+
+   Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a
+profiler such as `gcov' or `gprof', you can find out some basic
+performance statistics, such as:
+
+   * how often each line of code executes
+
+   * what lines of code are actually executed
+
+   * how much computing time each section of code uses
+
+   Once you know these things about how your code works when compiled,
+you can look at each module to see which modules should be optimized.
+`gcov' helps you determine where to work on optimization.
+
+   Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
+testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release.
+Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage
+program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the
+testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need
+to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a better
+final product.
+
+   You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use
+`gcov' because the optimization, by combining some lines of code into
+one function, may not give you as much information as you need to look
+for `hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer time.
+Likewise, because `gcov' accumulates statistics by line (at the lowest
+resolution), it works best with a programming style that places only
+one statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros that expand
+to loops or to other control structures, the statistics are less
+helpful--they only report on the line where the macro call appears.  If
+your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace them with
+inline functions to solve this problem.
+
+   `gcov' creates a logfile called `SOURCEFILE.gcov' which indicates
+how many times each line of a source file `SOURCEFILE.c' has executed.
+You can use these logfiles along with `gprof' to aid in fine-tuning the
+performance of your programs.  `gprof' gives timing information you can
+use along with the information you get from `gcov'.
+
+   `gcov' works only on code compiled with GNU CC.  It is not
+compatible with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.

+
+Invoking gcov
+=============
+
+     gcov [-b] [-v] [-n] [-l] [-f] [-o directory] SOURCEFILE
+
+`-b'
+     Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch
+     summary info to the standard output.  This option allows you to
+     see how often each branch in your program was taken.
+
+`-v'
+     Display the `gcov' version number (on the standard error stream).
+
+`-n'
+     Do not create the `gcov' output file.
+
+`-l'
+     Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if
+     the header file `x.h' contains code, and was included in the file
+     `a.c', then running `gcov' on the file `a.c' will produce an
+     output file called `a.c.x.h.gcov' instead of `x.h.gcov'.  This can
+     be useful if `x.h' is included in multiple source files.
+
+`-f'
+     Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level
+     summary.
+
+`-o'
+     The directory where the object files live.  Gcov will search for
+     `.bb', `.bbg', and `.da' files in this directory.
+
+   When using `gcov', you must first compile your program with two
+special GNU CC options: `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage'.  This tells
+the compiler to generate additional information needed by gcov
+(basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes additional
+code in the object files for generating the extra profiling information
+needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the directory
+where the source code is located.
+
+   Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For
+each source file compiled with -fprofile-arcs, an accompanying `.da'
+file will be placed in the source directory.
+
+   Running `gcov' with your program's source file names as arguments
+will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
+for each line.  For example, if your program is called `tmp.c', this is
+what you see when you use the basic `gcov' facility:
+
+     $ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage tmp.c
+     $ a.out
+     $ gcov tmp.c
+      87.50% of 8 source lines executed in file tmp.c
+     Creating tmp.c.gcov.
+
+   The file `tmp.c.gcov' contains output from `gcov'.  Here is a sample:
+
+                     main()
+                     {
+                1      int i, total;
+     
+                1      total = 0;
+     
+               11      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
+               10        total += i;
+     
+                1      if (total != 45)
+           ######        printf ("Failure\n");
+                       else
+                1        printf ("Success\n");
+                1    }
+
+   When you use the `-b' option, your output looks like this:
+
+     $ gcov -b tmp.c
+      87.50% of 8 source lines executed in file tmp.c
+      80.00% of 5 branches executed in file tmp.c
+      80.00% of 5 branches taken at least once in file tmp.c
+      50.00% of 2 calls executed in file tmp.c
+     Creating tmp.c.gcov.
+
+   Here is a sample of a resulting `tmp.c.gcov' file:
+
+                     main()
+                     {
+                1      int i, total;
+     
+                1      total = 0;
+     
+               11      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
+     branch 0 taken = 91%
+     branch 1 taken = 100%
+     branch 2 taken = 100%
+               10        total += i;
+     
+                1      if (total != 45)
+     branch 0 taken = 100%
+           ######        printf ("Failure\n");
+     call 0 never executed
+     branch 1 never executed
+                       else
+                1        printf ("Success\n");
+     call 0 returns = 100%
+                1    }
+
+   For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the
+basic block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.
+There can be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source
+line if there are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this
+case, the branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no
+simple way to map these branches and calls back to source constructs.
+In general, though, the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond
+to the leftmost construct on the source line.
+
+   For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
+indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
+number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
+message "never executed" is printed.
+
+   For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
+indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
+of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
+100%, but may be less for functions call `exit' or `longjmp', and thus
+may not return everytime they are called.
+
+   The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
+executed again without removing the `.da' file, the count for the
+number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
+the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
+several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
+number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
+provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
+program runs.
+
+   The data in the `.da' files is saved immediately before the program
+exits.  For each source file compiled with -fprofile-arcs, the profiling
+code first attempts to read in an existing `.da' file; if the file
+doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block counts) it
+will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the new execution
+counts and finally writes the data to the file.

+
+Using `gcov' with GCC Optimization
+==================================
+
+   If you plan to use `gcov' to help optimize your code, you must first
+compile your program with two special GNU CC options: `-fprofile-arcs
+-ftest-coverage'.  Aside from that, you can use any other GNU CC
+options; but if you want to prove that every single line in your
+program was executed, you should not compile with optimization at the
+same time.  On some machines the optimizer can eliminate some simple
+code lines by combining them with other lines.  For example, code like
+this:
+
+     if (a != b)
+       c = 1;
+     else
+       c = 0;
+
+can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In this case,
+there is no way for `gcov' to calculate separate execution counts for
+each line because there isn't separate code for each line.  Hence the
+`gcov' output looks like this if you compiled the program with
+optimization:
+
+           100  if (a != b)
+           100    c = 1;
+           100  else
+           100    c = 0;
+
+   The output shows that this block of code, combined by optimization,
+executed 100 times.  In one sense this result is correct, because there
+was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.  However,
+the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
+many times the result was 1.

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Gcov Data Files,  Prev: Gcov and Optimization,  Up: Gcov
+
+Brief description of `gcov' data files
+======================================
+
+   `gcov' uses three files for doing profiling.  The names of these
+files are derived from the original *source* file by substituting the
+file suffix with either `.bb', `.bbg', or `.da'.  All of these files
+are placed in the same directory as the source file, and contain data
+stored in a platform-independent method.
+
+   The `.bb' and `.bbg' files are generated when the source file is
+compiled with the GNU CC `-ftest-coverage' option.  The `.bb' file
+contains a list of source files (including headers), functions within
+those files, and line numbers corresponding to each basic block in the
+source file.
+
+   The `.bb' file format consists of several lists of 4-byte integers
+which correspond to the line numbers of each basic block in the file.
+Each list is terminated by a line number of 0.  A line number of -1 is
+used to designate that the source file name (padded to a 4-byte
+boundary and followed by another -1) follows.  In addition, a line
+number of -2 is used to designate that the name of a function (also
+padded to a 4-byte boundary and followed by a -2) follows.
+
+   The `.bbg' file is used to reconstruct the program flow graph for
+the source file.  It contains a list of the program flow arcs (possible
+branches taken from one basic block to another) for each function which,
+in combination with the `.bb' file, enables gcov to reconstruct the
+program flow.
+
+   In the `.bbg' file, the format is:
+             number of basic blocks for function #0 (4-byte number)
+             total number of arcs for function #0 (4-byte number)
+             count of arcs in basic block #0 (4-byte number)
+             destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
+             flag bits (4-byte number)
+             destination basic block of arc #1 (4-byte number)
+             flag bits (4-byte number)
+             ...
+             destination basic block of arc #N (4-byte number)
+             flag bits (4-byte number)
+             count of arcs in basic block #1 (4-byte number)
+             destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
+             flag bits (4-byte number)
+             ...
+
+   A -1 (stored as a 4-byte number) is used to separate each function's
+list of basic blocks, and to verify that the file has been read
+correctly.
+
+   The `.da' file is generated when a program containing object files
+built with the GNU CC `-fprofile-arcs' option is executed.  A separate
+`.da' file is created for each source file compiled with this option,
+and the name of the `.da' file is stored as an absolute pathname in the
+resulting object file.  This path name is derived from the source file
+name by substituting a `.da' suffix.
+
+   The format of the `.da' file is fairly simple.  The first 8-byte
+number is the number of counts in the file, followed by the counts
+(stored as 8-byte numbers).  Each count corresponds to the number of
+times each arc in the program is executed.  The counts are cumulative;
+each time the program is executed, it attemps to combine the existing
+`.da' files with the new counts for this invocation of the program.  It
+ignores the contents of any `.da' files whose number of arcs doesn't
+correspond to the current program, and merely overwrites them instead.
+
+   All three of these files use the functions in `gcov-io.h' to store
+integers; the functions in this header provide a machine-independent
+mechanism for storing and retrieving data from a stream.

+Known Causes of Trouble with GCC
+********************************
+
+   This section describes known problems that affect users of GCC.  Most
+of these are not GCC bugs per se--if they were, we would fix them.  But
+the result for a user may be like the result of a bug.
+
+   Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
+missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
+where people's opinions differ as to what is best.

+
+Actual Bugs We Haven't Fixed Yet
+================================
+
+   * The `fixincludes' script interacts badly with automounters; if the
+     directory of system header files is automounted, it tends to be
+     unmounted while `fixincludes' is running.  This would seem to be a
+     bug in the automounter.  We don't know any good way to work around
+     it.
+
+   * The `fixproto' script will sometimes add prototypes for the
+     `sigsetjmp' and `siglongjmp' functions that reference the
+     `jmp_buf' type before that type is defined.  To work around this,
+     edit the offending file and place the typedef in front of the
+     prototypes.
+
+   * There are several obscure case of mis-using struct, union, and
+     enum tags that are not detected as errors by the compiler.
+
+   * When `-pedantic-errors' is specified, GCC will incorrectly give an
+     error message when a function name is specified in an expression
+     involving the comma operator.
+
+   * Loop unrolling doesn't work properly for certain C++ programs.
+     This is a bug in the C++ front end.  It sometimes emits incorrect
+     debug info, and the loop unrolling code is unable to recover from
+     this error.

+
+Installation Problems
+=====================
+
+   This is a list of problems (and some apparent problems which don't
+really mean anything is wrong) that show up during installation of GNU
+CC.
+
+   * On certain systems, defining certain environment variables such as
+     `CC' can interfere with the functioning of `make'.
+
+   * If you encounter seemingly strange errors when trying to build the
+     compiler in a directory other than the source directory, it could
+     be because you have previously configured the compiler in the
+     source directory.  Make sure you have done all the necessary
+     preparations.  *Note Other Dir::.
+
+   * If you build GCC on a BSD system using a directory stored in a
+     System V file system, problems may occur in running `fixincludes'
+     if the System V file system doesn't support symbolic links.  These
+     problems result in a failure to fix the declaration of `size_t' in
+     `sys/types.h'.  If you find that `size_t' is a signed type and
+     that type mismatches occur, this could be the cause.
+
+     The solution is not to use such a directory for building GCC.
+
+   * In previous versions of GCC, the `gcc' driver program looked for
+     `as' and `ld' in various places; for example, in files beginning
+     with `/usr/local/lib/gcc-'.  GCC version 2 looks for them in the
+     directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION'.
+
+     Thus, to use a version of `as' or `ld' that is not the system
+     default, for example `gas' or GNU `ld', you must put them in that
+     directory (or make links to them from that directory).
+
+   * Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a
+     non-zero status) and be ignored by `make'.  These failures, which
+     are often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can
+     safely be ignored.
+
+   * It is normal to have warnings in compiling certain files about
+     unreachable code and about enumeration type clashes.  These files'
+     names begin with `insn-'.  Also, `real.c' may get some warnings
+     that you can ignore.
+
+   * Sometimes `make' recompiles parts of the compiler when installing
+     the compiler.  In one case, this was traced down to a bug in
+     `make'.  Either ignore the problem or switch to GNU Make.
+
+   * If you have installed a program known as purify, you may find that
+     it causes errors while linking `enquire', which is part of building
+     GCC.  The fix is to get rid of the file `real-ld' which purify
+     installs--so that GCC won't try to use it.
+
+   * On GNU/Linux SLS 1.01, there is a problem with `libc.a': it does
+     not contain the obstack functions.  However, GCC assumes that the
+     obstack functions are in `libc.a' when it is the GNU C library.
+     To work around this problem, change the `__GNU_LIBRARY__'
+     conditional around line 31 to `#if 1'.
+
+   * On some 386 systems, building the compiler never finishes because
+     `enquire' hangs due to a hardware problem in the motherboard--it
+     reports floating point exceptions to the kernel incorrectly.  You
+     can install GCC except for `float.h' by patching out the command to
+     run `enquire'.  You may also be able to fix the problem for real by
+     getting a replacement motherboard.  This problem was observed in
+     Revision E of the Micronics motherboard, and is fixed in Revision
+     F.  It has also been observed in the MYLEX MXA-33 motherboard.
+
+     If you encounter this problem, you may also want to consider
+     removing the FPU from the socket during the compilation.
+     Alternatively, if you are running SCO Unix, you can reboot and
+     force the FPU to be ignored.  To do this, type `hd(40)unix auto
+     ignorefpu'.
+
+   * On some 386 systems, GCC crashes trying to compile `enquire.c'.
+     This happens on machines that don't have a 387 FPU chip.  On 386
+     machines, the system kernel is supposed to emulate the 387 when you
+     don't have one.  The crash is due to a bug in the emulator.
+
+     One of these systems is the Unix from Interactive Systems: 386/ix.
+     On this system, an alternate emulator is provided, and it does
+     work.  To use it, execute this command as super-user:
+
+          ln /etc/emulator.rel1 /etc/emulator
+
+     and then reboot the system.  (The default emulator file remains
+     present under the name `emulator.dflt'.)
+
+     Try using `/etc/emulator.att', if you have such a problem on the
+     SCO system.
+
+     Another system which has this problem is Esix.  We don't know
+     whether it has an alternate emulator that works.
+
+     On NetBSD 0.8, a similar problem manifests itself as these error
+     messages:
+
+          enquire.c: In function `fprop':
+          enquire.c:2328: floating overflow
+
+   * On SCO systems, when compiling GCC with the system's compiler, do
+     not use `-O'.  Some versions of the system's compiler miscompile
+     GCC with `-O'.
+
+   * Sometimes on a Sun 4 you may observe a crash in the program
+     `genflags' or `genoutput' while building GCC.  This is said to be
+     due to a bug in `sh'.  You can probably get around it by running
+     `genflags' or `genoutput' manually and then retrying the `make'.
+
+   * On Solaris 2, executables of GCC version 2.0.2 are commonly
+     available, but they have a bug that shows up when compiling current
+     versions of GCC: undefined symbol errors occur during assembly if
+     you use `-g'.
+
+     The solution is to compile the current version of GCC without
+     `-g'.  That makes a working compiler which you can use to recompile
+     with `-g'.
+
+   * Solaris 2 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of
+     these packages are needed to use GCC fully.  If you did not
+     install all optional packages when installing Solaris, you will
+     need to verify that the packages that GCC needs are installed.
+
+     To check whether an optional package is installed, use the
+     `pkginfo' command.  To add an optional package, use the `pkgadd'
+     command.  For further details, see the Solaris documentation.
+
+     For Solaris 2.0 and 2.1, GCC needs six packages: `SUNWarc',
+     `SUNWbtool', `SUNWesu', `SUNWhea', `SUNWlibm', and `SUNWtoo'.
+
+     For Solaris 2.2, GCC needs an additional seventh package:
+     `SUNWsprot'.
+
+   * On Solaris 2, trying to use the linker and other tools in
+     `/usr/ucb' to install GCC has been observed to cause trouble.  For
+     example, the linker may hang indefinitely.  The fix is to remove
+     `/usr/ucb' from your `PATH'.
+
+   * If you use the 1.31 version of the MIPS assembler (such as was
+     shipped with Ultrix 3.1), you will need to use the
+     -fno-delayed-branch switch when optimizing floating point code.
+     Otherwise, the assembler will complain when the GCC compiler fills
+     a branch delay slot with a floating point instruction, such as
+     `add.d'.
+
+   * If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying "does not have
+     gp sections for all it's [sic] sectons [sic]", don't worry about
+     it.  This happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but
+     there is not really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the
+     output file.  You can stop such warnings by installing the GNU
+     linker.
+
+     It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they
+     are optional, and there should not be a warning about their
+     absence.
+
+   * In Ultrix 4.0 on the MIPS machine, `stdio.h' does not work with GNU
+     CC at all unless it has been fixed with `fixincludes'.  This causes
+     problems in building GCC.  Once GCC is installed, the problems go
+     away.
+
+     To work around this problem, when making the stage 1 compiler,
+     specify this option to Make:
+
+          GCC_FOR_TARGET="./xgcc -B./ -I./include"
+
+     When making stage 2 and stage 3, specify this option:
+
+          CFLAGS="-g -I./include"
+
+   * Users have reported some problems with version 2.0 of the MIPS
+     compiler tools that were shipped with Ultrix 4.1.  Version 2.10
+     which came with Ultrix 4.2 seems to work fine.
+
+     Users have also reported some problems with version 2.20 of the
+     MIPS compiler tools that were shipped with RISC/os 4.x.  The
+     earlier version 2.11 seems to work fine.
+
+   * Some versions of the MIPS linker will issue an assertion failure
+     when linking code that uses `alloca' against shared libraries on
+     RISC-OS 5.0, and DEC's OSF/1 systems.  This is a bug in the
+     linker, that is supposed to be fixed in future revisions.  To
+     protect against this, GCC passes `-non_shared' to the linker
+     unless you pass an explicit `-shared' or `-call_shared' switch.
+
+   * On System V release 3, you may get this error message while
+     linking:
+
+          ld fatal: failed to write symbol name SOMETHING
+           in strings table for file WHATEVER
+
+     This probably indicates that the disk is full or your ULIMIT won't
+     allow the file to be as large as it needs to be.
+
+     This problem can also result because the kernel parameter `MAXUMEM'
+     is too small.  If so, you must regenerate the kernel and make the
+     value much larger.  The default value is reported to be 1024; a
+     value of 32768 is said to work.  Smaller values may also work.
+
+   * On System V, if you get an error like this,
+
+          /usr/local/lib/bison.simple: In function `yyparse':
+          /usr/local/lib/bison.simple:625: virtual memory exhausted
+
+     that too indicates a problem with disk space, ULIMIT, or `MAXUMEM'.
+
+   * Current GCC versions probably do not work on version 2 of the NeXT
+     operating system.
+
+   * On NeXTStep 3.0, the Objective C compiler does not work, due,
+     apparently, to a kernel bug that it happens to trigger.  This
+     problem does not happen on 3.1.
+
+   * On the Tower models 4N0 and 6N0, by default a process is not
+     allowed to have more than one megabyte of memory.  GCC cannot
+     compile itself (or many other programs) with `-O' in that much
+     memory.
+
+     To solve this problem, reconfigure the kernel adding the following
+     line to the configuration file:
+
+          MAXUMEM = 4096
+
+   * On HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX release 8.0, there is a
+     bug in the assembler that must be fixed before GCC can be built.
+     This bug manifests itself during the first stage of compilation,
+     while building `libgcc2.a':
+
+          _floatdisf
+          cc1: warning: `-g' option not supported on this version of GCC
+          cc1: warning: `-g1' option not supported on this version of GCC
+          ./xgcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal signal 11
+
+     A patched version of the assembler is available by anonymous ftp
+     from `altdorf.ai.mit.edu' as the file
+     `archive/cph/hpux-8.0-assembler'.  If you have HP software support,
+     the patch can also be obtained directly from HP, as described in
+     the following note:
+
+          This is the patched assembler, to patch SR#1653-010439, where
+          the assembler aborts on floating point constants.
+
+          The bug is not really in the assembler, but in the shared
+          library version of the function "cvtnum(3c)".  The bug on
+          "cvtnum(3c)" is SR#4701-078451.  Anyway, the attached
+          assembler uses the archive library version of "cvtnum(3c)"
+          and thus does not exhibit the bug.
+
+     This patch is also known as PHCO_4484.
+
+   * On HP-UX version 8.05, but not on 8.07 or more recent versions,
+     the `fixproto' shell script triggers a bug in the system shell.
+     If you encounter this problem, upgrade your operating system or
+     use BASH (the GNU shell) to run `fixproto'.
+
+   * Some versions of the Pyramid C compiler are reported to be unable
+     to compile GCC.  You must use an older version of GCC for
+     bootstrapping.  One indication of this problem is if you get a
+     crash when GCC compiles the function `muldi3' in file `libgcc2.c'.
+
+     You may be able to succeed by getting GCC version 1, installing it,
+     and using it to compile GCC version 2.  The bug in the Pyramid C
+     compiler does not seem to affect GCC version 1.
+
+   * There may be similar problems on System V Release 3.1 on 386
+     systems.
+
+   * On the Intel Paragon (an i860 machine), if you are using operating
+     system version 1.0, you will get warnings or errors about
+     redefinition of `va_arg' when you build GCC.
+
+     If this happens, then you need to link most programs with the
+     library `iclib.a'.  You must also modify `stdio.h' as follows:
+     before the lines
+
+          #if     defined(__i860__) && !defined(_VA_LIST)
+          #include <va_list.h>
+
+     insert the line
+
+          #if __PGC__
+
+     and after the lines
+
+          extern int  vprintf(const char *, va_list );
+          extern int  vsprintf(char *, const char *, va_list );
+          #endif
+
+     insert the line
+
+          #endif /* __PGC__ */
+
+     These problems don't exist in operating system version 1.1.
+
+   * On the Altos 3068, programs compiled with GCC won't work unless you
+     fix a kernel bug.  This happens using system versions V.2.2 1.0gT1
+     and V.2.2 1.0e and perhaps later versions as well.  See the file
+     `README.ALTOS'.
+
+   * You will get several sorts of compilation and linking errors on the
+     we32k if you don't follow the special instructions.  *Note
+     Configurations::.
+
+   * A bug in the HP-UX 8.05 (and earlier) shell will cause the fixproto
+     program to report an error of the form:
+
+          ./fixproto: sh internal 1K buffer overflow
+
+     To fix this, change the first line of the fixproto script to look
+     like:
+
+          #!/bin/ksh

+
+Cross-Compiler Problems
+=======================
+
+   You may run into problems with cross compilation on certain machines,
+for several reasons.
+
+   * Cross compilation can run into trouble for certain machines because
+     some target machines' assemblers require floating point numbers to
+     be written as *integer* constants in certain contexts.
+
+     The compiler writes these integer constants by examining the
+     floating point value as an integer and printing that integer,
+     because this is simple to write and independent of the details of
+     the floating point representation.  But this does not work if the
+     compiler is running on a different machine with an incompatible
+     floating point format, or even a different byte-ordering.
+
+     In addition, correct constant folding of floating point values
+     requires representing them in the target machine's format.  (The C
+     standard does not quite require this, but in practice it is the
+     only way to win.)
+
+     It is now possible to overcome these problems by defining macros
+     such as `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  But doing so is a substantial amount of
+     work for each target machine.  *Note Cross-compilation::.
+
+   * At present, the program `mips-tfile' which adds debug support to
+     object files on MIPS systems does not work in a cross compile
+     environment.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Interoperation,  Next: External Bugs,  Prev: Cross-Compiler Problems,  Up: Trouble
+
+Interoperation
+==============
+
+   This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GNU C or
+GNU C++ together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers,
+libraries and debuggers on certain systems.
+
+   * Objective C does not work on the RS/6000.
+
+   * GNU C++ does not do name mangling in the same way as other C++
+     compilers.  This means that object files compiled with one compiler
+     cannot be used with another.
+
+     This effect is intentional, to protect you from more subtle
+     problems.  Compilers differ as to many internal details of C++
+     implementation, including: how class instances are laid out, how
+     multiple inheritance is implemented, and how virtual function
+     calls are handled.  If the name encoding were made the same, your
+     programs would link against libraries provided from other
+     compilers--but the programs would then crash when run.
+     Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
+     at run time.
+
+   * Older GDB versions sometimes fail to read the output of GCC version
+     2.  If you have trouble, get GDB version 4.4 or later.
+
+   * DBX rejects some files produced by GCC, though it accepts similar
+     constructs in output from PCC.  Until someone can supply a coherent
+     description of what is valid DBX input and what is not, there is
+     nothing I can do about these problems.  You are on your own.
+
+   * The GNU assembler (GAS) does not support PIC.  To generate PIC
+     code, you must use some other assembler, such as `/bin/as'.
+
+   * On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of
+     profiling causes static variable destructors (currently used only
+     in C++) not to be run.
+
+   * Use of `-I/usr/include' may cause trouble.
+
+     Many systems come with header files that won't work with GCC unless
+     corrected by `fixincludes'.  The corrected header files go in a new
+     directory; GCC searches this directory before `/usr/include'.  If
+     you use `-I/usr/include', this tells GCC to search `/usr/include'
+     earlier on, before the corrected headers.  The result is that you
+     get the uncorrected header files.
+
+     Instead, you should use these options (when compiling C programs):
+
+          -I/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION/include -I/usr/include
+
+     For C++ programs, GCC also uses a special directory that defines
+     C++ interfaces to standard C subroutines.  This directory is meant
+     to be searched *before* other standard include directories, so
+     that it takes precedence.  If you are compiling C++ programs and
+     specifying include directories explicitly, use this option first,
+     then the two options above:
+
+          -I/usr/local/lib/g++-include
+
+   * On some SGI systems, when you use `-lgl_s' as an option, it gets
+     translated magically to `-lgl_s -lX11_s -lc_s'.  Naturally, this
+     does not happen when you use GCC.  You must specify all three
+     options explicitly.
+
+   * On a Sparc, GCC aligns all values of type `double' on an 8-byte
+     boundary, and it expects every `double' to be so aligned.  The Sun
+     compiler usually gives `double' values 8-byte alignment, with one
+     exception: function arguments of type `double' may not be aligned.
+
+     As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address
+     of an argument of type `double' and passes this pointer of type
+     `double *' to a function compiled with GCC, dereferencing the
+     pointer may cause a fatal signal.
+
+     One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program
+     with GNU CC.  Another solution is to modify the function that is
+     compiled with Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable;
+     local variables are always properly aligned.  A third solution is
+     to modify the function that uses the pointer to dereference it via
+     the following function `access_double' instead of directly with
+     `*':
+
+          inline double
+          access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
+          {
+            union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };
+          
+            union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
+            union d2i u;
+          
+            u.i[0] = p->i[0];
+            u.i[1] = p->i[1];
+          
+            return u.d;
+          }
+
+     Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.
+
+   * On Solaris, the `malloc' function in the `libmalloc.a' library may
+     allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GCC on the
+     Sparc assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
+     fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
+     `libmalloc.a' library.
+
+     The solution is to not use the `libmalloc.a' library.  Use instead
+     `malloc' and related functions from `libc.a'; they do not have
+     this problem.
+
+   * Sun forgot to include a static version of `libdl.a' with some
+     versions of SunOS (mainly 4.1).  This results in undefined symbols
+     when linking static binaries (that is, if you use `-static').  If
+     you see undefined symbols `_dlclose', `_dlsym' or `_dlopen' when
+     linking, compile and link against the file `mit/util/misc/dlsym.c'
+     from the MIT version of X windows.
+
+   * The 128-bit long double format that the Sparc port supports
+     currently works by using the architecturally defined quad-word
+     floating point instructions.  Since there is no hardware that
+     supports these instructions they must be emulated by the operating
+     system.  Long doubles do not work in Sun OS versions 4.0.3 and
+     earlier, because the kernel emulator uses an obsolete and
+     incompatible format.  Long doubles do not work in Sun OS version
+     4.1.1 due to a problem in a Sun library.  Long doubles do work on
+     Sun OS versions 4.1.2 and higher, but GCC does not enable them by
+     default.  Long doubles appear to work in Sun OS 5.x (Solaris 2.x).
+
+   * On HP-UX version 9.01 on the HP PA, the HP compiler `cc' does not
+     compile GCC correctly.  We do not yet know why.  However, GCC
+     compiled on earlier HP-UX versions works properly on HP-UX 9.01
+     and can compile itself properly on 9.01.
+
+   * On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions
+     compiled with GCC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions
+     that use `alloca' or variable-size arrays.  This is because GCC
+     doesn't generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It
+     may even be impossible to generate them.
+
+   * Debugging (`-g') is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you
+     use the preliminary GNU tools (*note Installation::.).
+
+   * Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX
+     PA assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.
+
+   * Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static
+     functions will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply
+     is no way for GCC to specify what registers hold arguments for
+     static functions when using the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does
+     not have this problem.
+
+   * In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
+     receive errors from the HP linker complaining about an out of
+     bounds unconditional branch offset.  This used to occur more often
+     in previous versions of GCC, but is now exceptionally rare.  If
+     you should run into it, you can work around by making your
+     function smaller.
+
+   * GCC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX
+     assembler of the form:
+
+          (warning) Use of GR3 when
+            frame >= 8192 may cause conflict.
+
+     These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.
+
+   * The current version of the assembler (`/bin/as') for the RS/6000
+     has certain problems that prevent the `-g' option in GCC from
+     working.  Note that `Makefile.in' uses `-g' by default when
+     compiling `libgcc2.c'.
+
+     IBM has produced a fixed version of the assembler.  The upgraded
+     assembler unfortunately was not included in any of the AIX 3.2
+     update PTF releases (3.2.2, 3.2.3, or 3.2.3e).  Users of AIX 3.1
+     should request PTF U403044 from IBM and users of AIX 3.2 should
+     request PTF U416277.  See the file `README.RS6000' for more
+     details on these updates.
+
+     You can test for the presense of a fixed assembler by using the
+     command
+
+          as -u < /dev/null
+
+     If the command exits normally, the assembler fix already is
+     installed.  If the assembler complains that "-u" is an unknown
+     flag, you need to order the fix.
+
+   * On the IBM RS/6000, compiling code of the form
+
+          extern int foo;
+          
+          ... foo ...
+          
+          static int foo;
+
+     will cause the linker to report an undefined symbol `foo'.
+     Although this behavior differs from most other systems, it is not a
+     bug because redefining an `extern' variable as `static' is
+     undefined in ANSI C.
+
+   * AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside
+     of the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
+     locale-specific representations of various objects including
+     floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal
+     fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library
+     linked with GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats
+     that the assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set the
+     LANG environment variable to "C" or "En_US".
+
+   * Even if you specify `-fdollars-in-identifiers', you cannot
+     successfully use `$' in identifiers on the RS/6000 due to a
+     restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these identifiers.
+
+   * On the RS/6000, XLC version 1.3.0.0 will miscompile `jump.c'.  XLC
+     version 1.3.0.1 or later fixes this problem.  You can obtain
+     XLC-1.3.0.2 by requesting PTF 421749 from IBM.
+
+   * There is an assembler bug in versions of DG/UX prior to 5.4.2.01
+     that occurs when the `fldcr' instruction is used.  GCC uses
+     `fldcr' on the 88100 to serialize volatile memory references.  Use
+     the option `-mno-serialize-volatile' if your version of the
+     assembler has this bug.
+
+   * On VMS, GAS versions 1.38.1 and earlier may cause spurious warning
+     messages from the linker.  These warning messages complain of
+     mismatched psect attributes.  You can ignore them.  *Note VMS
+     Install::.
+
+   * On NewsOS version 3, if you include both of the files `stddef.h'
+     and `sys/types.h', you get an error because there are two typedefs
+     of `size_t'.  You should change `sys/types.h' by adding these
+     lines around the definition of `size_t':
+
+          #ifndef _SIZE_T
+          #define _SIZE_T
+          ACTUAL TYPEDEF HERE
+          #endif
+
+   * On the Alliant, the system's own convention for returning
+     structures and unions is unusual, and is not compatible with GCC
+     no matter what options are used.
+
+   * On the IBM RT PC, the MetaWare HighC compiler (hc) uses a different
+     convention for structure and union returning.  Use the option
+     `-mhc-struct-return' to tell GCC to use a convention compatible
+     with it.
+
+   * On Ultrix, the Fortran compiler expects registers 2 through 5 to
+     be saved by function calls.  However, the C compiler uses
+     conventions compatible with BSD Unix: registers 2 through 5 may be
+     clobbered by function calls.
+
+     GCC uses the same convention as the Ultrix C compiler.  You can use
+     these options to produce code compatible with the Fortran compiler:
+
+          -fcall-saved-r2 -fcall-saved-r3 -fcall-saved-r4 -fcall-saved-r5
+
+   * On the WE32k, you may find that programs compiled with GCC do not
+     work with the standard shared C library.  You may need to link with
+     the ordinary C compiler.  If you do so, you must specify the
+     following options:
+
+          -L/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/we32k-att-sysv/2.8.1 -lgcc -lc_s
+
+     The first specifies where to find the library `libgcc.a' specified
+     with the `-lgcc' option.
+
+     GCC does linking by invoking `ld', just as `cc' does, and there is
+     no reason why it *should* matter which compilation program you use
+     to invoke `ld'.  If someone tracks this problem down, it can
+     probably be fixed easily.
+
+   * On the Alpha, you may get assembler errors about invalid syntax as
+     a result of floating point constants.  This is due to a bug in the
+     C library functions `ecvt', `fcvt' and `gcvt'.  Given valid
+     floating point numbers, they sometimes print `NaN'.
+
+   * On Irix 4.0.5F (and perhaps in some other versions), an assembler
+     bug sometimes reorders instructions incorrectly when optimization
+     is turned on.  If you think this may be happening to you, try
+     using the GNU assembler; GAS version 2.1 supports ECOFF on Irix.
+
+     Or use the `-noasmopt' option when you compile GCC with itself,
+     and then again when you compile your program.  (This is a temporary
+     kludge to turn off assembler optimization on Irix.)  If this
+     proves to be what you need, edit the assembler spec in the file
+     `specs' so that it unconditionally passes `-O0' to the assembler,
+     and never passes `-O2' or `-O3'.

+Problems Compiling Certain Programs
+===================================
+
+   Certain programs have problems compiling.
+
+   * Parse errors may occur compiling X11 on a Decstation running
+     Ultrix 4.2 because of problems in DEC's versions of the X11 header
+     files `X11/Xlib.h' and `X11/Xutil.h'.  People recommend adding
+     `-I/usr/include/mit' to use the MIT versions of the header files,
+     using the `-traditional' switch to turn off ANSI C, or fixing the
+     header files by adding this:
+
+          #ifdef __STDC__
+          #define NeedFunctionPrototypes 0
+          #endif
+
+   * If you have trouble compiling Perl on a SunOS 4 system, it may be
+     because Perl specifies `-I/usr/ucbinclude'.  This accesses the
+     unfixed header files.  Perl specifies the options
+
+          -traditional -Dvolatile=__volatile__
+          -I/usr/include/sun -I/usr/ucbinclude
+          -fpcc-struct-return
+
+     most of which are unnecessary with GCC 2.4.5 and newer versions.
+     You can make a properly working Perl by setting `ccflags' to
+     `-fwritable-strings' (implied by the `-traditional' in the
+     original options) and `cppflags' to empty in `config.sh', then
+     typing `./doSH; make depend; make'.
+
+   * On various 386 Unix systems derived from System V, including SCO,
+     ISC, and ESIX, you may get error messages about running out of
+     virtual memory while compiling certain programs.
+
+     You can prevent this problem by linking GCC with the GNU malloc
+     (which thus replaces the malloc that comes with the system).  GNU
+     malloc is available as a separate package, and also in the file
+     `src/gmalloc.c' in the GNU Emacs 19 distribution.
+
+     If you have installed GNU malloc as a separate library package,
+     use this option when you relink GCC:
+
+          MALLOC=/usr/local/lib/libgmalloc.a
+
+     Alternatively, if you have compiled `gmalloc.c' from Emacs 19, copy
+     the object file to `gmalloc.o' and use this option when you relink
+     GCC:
+
+          MALLOC=gmalloc.o

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Incompatibilities,  Next: Fixed Headers,  Prev: External Bugs,  Up: Trouble
+
+Incompatibilities of GCC
+========================
+
+   There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and most
+existing (non-ANSI) versions of C.  The `-traditional' option
+eliminates many of these incompatibilities, *but not all*, by telling
+GNU C to behave like the other C compilers.
+
+   * GCC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
+     identical-looking string constants are used, GCC stores only one
+     copy of the string.
+
+     One consequence is that you cannot call `mktemp' with a string
+     constant argument.  The function `mktemp' always alters the string
+     its argument points to.
+
+     Another consequence is that `sscanf' does not work on some systems
+     when passed a string constant as its format control string or
+     input.  This is because `sscanf' incorrectly tries to write into
+     the string constant.  Likewise `fscanf' and `scanf'.
+
+     The best solution to these problems is to change the program to use
+     `char'-array variables with initialization strings for these
+     purposes instead of string constants.  But if this is not possible,
+     you can use the `-fwritable-strings' flag, which directs GCC to
+     handle string constants the same way most C compilers do.
+     `-traditional' also has this effect, among others.
+
+   * `-2147483648' is positive.
+
+     This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type `int', so
+     (following the ANSI C rules) its data type is `unsigned long int'.
+     Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.
+
+   * GCC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
+     string constants.  For example, the following macro in GCC
+
+          #define foo(a) "a"
+
+     will produce output `"a"' regardless of what the argument A is.
+
+     The `-traditional' option directs GCC to handle such cases (among
+     others) in the old-fashioned (non-ANSI) fashion.
+
+   * When you use `setjmp' and `longjmp', the only automatic variables
+     guaranteed to remain valid are those declared `volatile'.  This is
+     a consequence of automatic register allocation.  Consider this
+     function:
+
+          jmp_buf j;
+          
+          foo ()
+          {
+            int a, b;
+          
+            a = fun1 ();
+            if (setjmp (j))
+              return a;
+          
+            a = fun2 ();
+            /* `longjmp (j)' may occur in `fun3'. */
+            return a + fun3 ();
+          }
+
+     Here `a' may or may not be restored to its first value when the
+     `longjmp' occurs.  If `a' is allocated in a register, then its
+     first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
+     in it.
+
+     If you use the `-W' option with the `-O' option, you will get a
+     warning when GCC thinks such a problem might be possible.
+
+     The `-traditional' option directs GNU C to put variables in the
+     stack by default, rather than in registers, in functions that call
+     `setjmp'.  This results in the behavior found in traditional C
+     compilers.
+
+   * Programs that use preprocessing directives in the middle of macro
+     arguments do not work with GCC.  For example, a program like this
+     will not work:
+
+          foobar (
+          #define luser
+                  hack)
+
+     ANSI C does not permit such a construct.  It would make sense to
+     support it when `-traditional' is used, but it is too much work to
+     implement.
+
+   * Declarations of external variables and functions within a block
+     apply only to the block containing the declaration.  In other
+     words, they have the same scope as any other declaration in the
+     same place.
+
+     In some other C compilers, a `extern' declaration affects all the
+     rest of the file even if it happens within a block.
+
+     The `-traditional' option directs GNU C to treat all `extern'
+     declarations as global, like traditional compilers.
+
+   * In traditional C, you can combine `long', etc., with a typedef
+     name, as shown here:
+
+          typedef int foo;
+          typedef long foo bar;
+
+     In ANSI C, this is not allowed: `long' and other type modifiers
+     require an explicit `int'.  Because this criterion is expressed by
+     Bison grammar rules rather than C code, the `-traditional' flag
+     cannot alter it.
+
+   * PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.  The
+     difficulty described immediately above applies here too.
+
+   * PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment
+     operators such as `+='.  GCC, following the ANSI standard, does not
+     allow this.  The difficulty described immediately above applies
+     here too.
+
+   * GCC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
+     preprocessing conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
+     comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if
+     these comments contain apostrophes, GCC will probably report an
+     error.  For example, this code would produce an error:
+
+          #if 0
+          You can't expect this to work.
+          #endif
+
+     The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an
+     actual C comment delimited by `/*...*/'.  However, `-traditional'
+     suppresses these error messages.
+
+   * Many user programs contain the declaration `long time ();'.  In the
+     past, the system header files on many systems did not actually
+     declare `time', so it did not matter what type your program
+     declared it to return.  But in systems with ANSI C headers, `time'
+     is declared to return `time_t', and if that is not the same as
+     `long', then `long time ();' is erroneous.
+
+     The solution is to change your program to use `time_t' as the
+     return type of `time'.
+
+   * When compiling functions that return `float', PCC converts it to a
+     double.  GCC actually returns a `float'.  If you are concerned
+     with PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
+     `double'; you might as well say what you mean.
+
+   * When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GCC
+     output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
+     versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GCC cannot call
+     a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.
+
+     The method used by GCC is as follows: a structure or union which is
+     1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or
+     union with any other size is stored into an address supplied by
+     the caller (usually in a special, fixed register, but on some
+     machines it is passed on the stack).  The machine-description
+     macros `STRUCT_VALUE' and `STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE' tell GCC where
+     to pass this address.
+
+     By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and
+     unions of any size by copying the data into an area of static
+     storage, and then returning the address of that storage as if it
+     were a pointer value.  The caller must copy the data from that
+     memory area to the place where the value is wanted.  GCC does not
+     use this method because it is slower and nonreentrant.
+
+     On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
+     structure and union returning.  GCC on most of these machines uses
+     a compatible convention when returning structures and unions in
+     memory, but still returns small structures and unions in registers.
+
+     You can tell GCC to use a compatible convention for all structure
+     and union returning with the option `-fpcc-struct-return'.
+
+   * GNU C complains about program fragments such as `0x74ae-0x4000'
+     which appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
+     operator.  Actually, this string is a single "preprocessing token".
+     Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this
+     does not, GNU C prints an error message.  Although it may appear
+     obvious that what is meant is an operator and two values, the ANSI
+     C standard specifically requires that this be treated as erroneous.
+
+     A "preprocessing token" is a "preprocessing number" if it begins
+     with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
+     periods and `e+', `e-', `E+', or `E-' character sequences.
+
+     To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in
+     front of the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the
+     preprocessing number.

+
+Fixed Header Files
+==================
+
+   GCC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files.
+This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
+work with GCC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
+incompatible with ANSI C, and some depend on special features of other
+compilers.
+
+   Installing GCC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
+files, by running a program called `fixincludes' (or for certain
+targets an alternative such as `fixinc.svr4').  Normally, you don't
+need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it doesn't do
+the right thing automatically.
+
+   * If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a
+     new system version, the fixed header files of GCC are not
+     automatically updated.  The easiest way to update them is to
+     reinstall GCC.  (If you want to be clever, look in the makefile
+     and you can find a shortcut.)
+
+   * On some systems, in particular SunOS 4, header file directories
+     contain machine-specific symbolic links in certain places.  This
+     makes it possible to share most of the header files among hosts
+     running the same version of SunOS 4 on different machine models.
+
+     The programs that fix the header files do not understand this
+     special way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of
+     fixed header files is good only for the machine model used to
+     build it.
+
+     In SunOS 4, only programs that look inside the kernel will notice
+     the difference between machine models.  Therefore, for most
+     purposes, you need not be concerned about this.
+
+     It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
+     different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic
+     links so as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by
+     hand.
+
+   * On Lynxos, GCC by default does not fix the header files.  This is
+     because bugs in the shell cause the `fixincludes' script to fail.
+
+     This means you will encounter problems due to bugs in the system
+     header files.  It may be no comfort that they aren't GCC's fault,
+     but it does mean that there's nothing for us to do about them.

+
+Standard Libraries
+==================
+
+   GCC by itself attempts to be what the ISO/ANSI C standard calls a
+"conforming freestanding implementation".  This means all ANSI C
+language features are available, as well as the contents of `float.h',
+`limits.h', `stdarg.h', and `stddef.h'.  The rest of the C library is
+supplied by the vendor of the operating system.  If that C library
+doesn't conform to the C standards, then your programs might get
+warnings (especially when using `-Wall') that you don't expect.
+
+   For example, the `sprintf' function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns `char *'
+while the C standard says that `sprintf' returns an `int'.  The
+`fixincludes' program could make the prototype for this function match
+the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the function will still
+return `char *'.
+
+   If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one,
+as GCC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called `glibc') has
+been ported to a number of operating systems, and provides ANSI/ISO,
+POSIX, BSD and SystemV compatibility.  You could also ask your operating
+system vendor if newer libraries are available.
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Disappointments,  Next: C++ Misunderstandings,  Prev: Standard Libraries,  Up: Trouble
+
+Disappointments and Misunderstandings
+=====================================
+
+   These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any
+practical way around them.
+
+   * Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you
+     compile with optimization.
+
+     This occurs because sometimes GCC optimizes the variable out of
+     existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
+     value such a variable "would have had", and it is not clear that
+     would be desirable anyway.  So GCC simply does not mention the
+     eliminated variable when it writes debugging information.
+
+     You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
+     executable and your source code, when you use optimization.
+
+   * Users often think it is a bug when GCC reports an error for code
+     like this:
+
+          int foo (struct mumble *);
+          
+          struct mumble { ... };
+          
+          int foo (struct mumble *x)
+          { ... }
+
+     This code really is erroneous, because the scope of `struct
+     mumble' in the prototype is limited to the argument list
+     containing it.  It does not refer to the `struct mumble' defined
+     with file scope immediately below--they are two unrelated types
+     with similar names in different scopes.
+
+     But in the definition of `foo', the file-scope type is used
+     because that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition
+     and the prototype do not match, and you get an error.
+
+     This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ANSI standard
+     specifies.  It is easy enough for you to make your code work by
+     moving the definition of `struct mumble' above the prototype.
+     It's not worth being incompatible with ANSI C just to avoid an
+     error for the example shown above.
+
+   * Accesses to bitfields even in volatile objects works by accessing
+     larger objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what
+     size of object is accessed in order to read or write the bitfield;
+     it may even vary for a given bitfield according to the precise
+     usage.
+
+     If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is
+     accessed, use volatile but do not use bitfields.
+
+   * GCC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in
+     system header files.  They install corrected copies of various
+     header files in a special directory where only GCC will normally
+     look for them.  The scripts adapt to various systems by searching
+     all the system header files for the problem cases that we know
+     about.
+
+     If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically
+     arranges to update the corrected header files.  You will have to
+     reinstall GCC to fix the new header files.  More specifically, go
+     to the build directory and delete the files `stmp-fixinc' and
+     `stmp-headers', and the subdirectory `include'; then do `make
+     install' again.
+
+   * On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical
+     results if you test the precise values of floating point numbers.
+     For example, you can find that a floating point value which is not
+     a NaN is not equal to itself.  This results from the fact that the
+     floating point registers hold a few more bits of precision than
+     fit in a `double' in memory.  Compiled code moves values between
+     memory and floating point registers at its convenience, and moving
+     them into memory truncates them.
+
+     You can partially avoid this problem by using the `-ffloat-store'
+     option (*note Optimize Options::.).
+
+   * On the MIPS, variable argument functions using `varargs.h' cannot
+     have a floating point value for the first argument.  The reason
+     for this is that in the absence of a prototype in scope, if the
+     first argument is a floating point, it is passed in a floating
+     point register, rather than an integer register.
+
+     If the code is rewritten to use the ANSI standard `stdarg.h'
+     method of variable arguments, and the prototype is in scope at the
+     time of the call, everything will work fine.
+
+   * On the H8/300 and H8/300H, variable argument functions must be
+     implemented using the ANSI standard `stdarg.h' method of variable
+     arguments.  Furthermore, calls to functions using `stdarg.h'
+     variable arguments must have a prototype for the called function
+     in scope at the time of the call.

+Common Misunderstandings with GNU C++
+=====================================
+
+   C++ is a complex language and an evolving one, and its standard
+definition (the ISO C++ standard) was only recently completed.  As a
+result, your C++ compiler may occasionally surprise you, even when its
+behavior is correct.  This section discusses some areas that frequently
+give rise to questions of this sort.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Static Definitions::  Static member declarations are not definitions
+* Temporaries::         Temporaries may vanish before you expect
+* Copy Assignment::     Copy Assignment operators copy virtual bases twice

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Static Definitions,  Next: Temporaries,  Up: C++ Misunderstandings
+
+Declare *and* Define Static Members
+-----------------------------------
+
+   When a class has static data members, it is not enough to *declare*
+the static member; you must also *define* it.  For example:
+
+     class Foo
+     {
+       ...
+       void method();
+       static int bar;
+     };
+
+   This declaration only establishes that the class `Foo' has an `int'
+named `Foo::bar', and a member function named `Foo::method'.  But you
+still need to define *both* `method' and `bar' elsewhere.  According to
+the draft ANSI standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and
+only one) source file, such as:
+
+     int Foo::bar = 0;
+
+   Other C++ compilers may not correctly implement the standard
+behavior.  As a result, when you switch to `g++' from one of these
+compilers, you may discover that a program that appeared to work
+correctly in fact does not conform to the standard: `g++' reports as
+undefined symbols any static data members that lack definitions.

+
+Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect
+----------------------------------------
+
+   It is dangerous to use pointers or references to *portions* of a
+temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
+you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
+where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes,
+especially ones that define a conversion function to type `char *' or
+`const char *' - which is one reason why the standard `string' class
+requires you to call the `c_str' member function.  However, any class
+that returns a pointer to some internal structure is potentially
+subject to this problem.
+
+   For example, a program may use a function `strfunc' that returns
+`string' objects, and another function `charfunc' that operates on
+pointers to `char':
+
+     string strfunc ();
+     void charfunc (const char *);
+     
+     void
+     f ()
+     {
+       const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
+       ...
+       charfunc (p);
+       ...
+       charfunc (p);
+     }
+
+In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C
+string returned by the `c_str' member function and use that rather than
+call `c_str' repeatedly.  However, the temporary string created by the
+call to `strfunc' is destroyed after `p' is initialized, at which point
+`p' is left pointing to freed memory.
+
+   Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
+particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries
+along with normal local variables.  However, the GNU C++ behavior is
+standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of
+temporaries it is not portable.
+
+   The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name,
+which forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name.  For
+example:
+
+     string& tmp = strfunc ();
+     charfunc (tmp.c_str ());

+
+Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases
+------------------------------------------
+
+   When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
+belongs to each full object. Also, the constructors and destructors are
+invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class. However, such
+objects behave unspecified when being assigned. For example:
+
+     struct Base{
+       char *name;
+       Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
+       Base& operator= (const Base& other){
+        free (name);
+        name = strdup (other.name);
+       }
+     };
+     
+     struct A:virtual Base{
+       int val;
+       A():Base("A"){}
+     };
+     
+     struct B:virtual Base{
+       int bval;
+       B():Base("B"){}
+     };
+     
+     struct Derived:public A, public B{
+       Derived():Base("Derived"){}
+     };
+     
+     void func(Derived &d1, Derived &d2)
+     {
+       d1 = d2;
+     }
+
+   The C++ standard specifies that `Base::Base' is only called once
+when constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object. It is
+unspecified whether `Base::operator=' is called more than once when the
+implicit copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is
+inside `func' in the example).
+
+   g++ implements the "intuitive" algorithm for copy-assignment: assign
+all direct bases, then assign all members. In that algorithm, the
+virtual base subobject can be encountered many times. In the example,
+copying proceeds in the following order: `val', `name' (via `strdup'),
+`bval', and `name' again.
+
+   If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
+copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties. With such an
+operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
+subobject is assigned.

+
+Caveats of using `protoize'
+===========================
+
+   The conversion programs `protoize' and `unprotoize' can sometimes
+change a source file in a way that won't work unless you rearrange it.
+
+   * `protoize' can insert references to a type name or type tag before
+     the definition, or in a file where they are not defined.
+
+     If this happens, compiler error messages should show you where the
+     new references are, so fixing the file by hand is straightforward.
+
+   * There are some C constructs which `protoize' cannot figure out.
+     For example, it can't determine argument types for declaring a
+     pointer-to-function variable; this you must do by hand.  `protoize'
+     inserts a comment containing `???' each time it finds such a
+     variable; so you can find all such variables by searching for this
+     string.  ANSI C does not require declaring the argument types of
+     pointer-to-function types.
+
+   * Using `unprotoize' can easily introduce bugs.  If the program
+     relied on prototypes to bring about conversion of arguments, these
+     conversions will not take place in the program without prototypes.
+     One case in which you can be sure `unprotoize' is safe is when you
+     are removing prototypes that were made with `protoize'; if the
+     program worked before without any prototypes, it will work again
+     without them.
+
+     You can find all the places where this problem might occur by
+     compiling the program with the `-Wconversion' option.  It prints a
+     warning whenever an argument is converted.
+
+   * Both conversion programs can be confused if there are macro calls
+     in and around the text to be converted.  In other words, the
+     standard syntax for a declaration or definition must not result
+     from expanding a macro.  This problem is inherent in the design of
+     C and cannot be fixed.  If only a few functions have confusing
+     macro calls, you can easily convert them manually.
+
+   * `protoize' cannot get the argument types for a function whose
+     definition was not actually compiled due to preprocessing
+     conditionals.  When this happens, `protoize' changes nothing in
+     regard to such a function.  `protoize' tries to detect such
+     instances and warn about them.
+
+     You can generally work around this problem by using `protoize' step
+     by step, each time specifying a different set of `-D' options for
+     compilation, until all of the functions have been converted.
+     There is no automatic way to verify that you have got them all,
+     however.
+
+   * Confusion may result if there is an occasion to convert a function
+     declaration or definition in a region of source code where there
+     is more than one formal parameter list present.  Thus, attempts to
+     convert code containing multiple (conditionally compiled) versions
+     of a single function header (in the same vicinity) may not produce
+     the desired (or expected) results.
+
+     If you plan on converting source files which contain such code, it
+     is recommended that you first make sure that each conditionally
+     compiled region of source code which contains an alternative
+     function header also contains at least one additional follower
+     token (past the final right parenthesis of the function header).
+     This should circumvent the problem.
+
+   * `unprotoize' can become confused when trying to convert a function
+     definition or declaration which contains a declaration for a
+     pointer-to-function formal argument which has the same name as the
+     function being defined or declared.  We recommand you avoid such
+     choices of formal parameter names.
+
+   * You might also want to correct some of the indentation by hand and
+     break long lines.  (The conversion programs don't write lines
+     longer than eighty characters in any case.)

+
+Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make
+=====================================
+
+   This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
+we do not make because we think GCC is better without them.
+
+   * Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has
+     an old-fashioned definition and no prototype.
+
+     Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that
+     appear in the same file as the called function, following the
+     definition.  The only way to check all calls reliably is to add a
+     prototype for the function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the
+     motivation for this feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.
+
+   * Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift
+     count.
+
+     Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned.
+     Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.
+
+   * Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.
+
+     Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would
+     cause more annoyance than good.
+
+   * Warning about unreachable code.
+
+     It's very common to have unreachable code in machine-generated
+     programs.  For example, this happens normally in some files of GNU
+     C itself.
+
+   * Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.
+
+     Coming as I do from a Lisp background, I balk at the idea that
+     there is something dangerous about discarding a value.  There are
+     functions that return values which some callers may find useful;
+     it makes no sense to clutter the program with a cast to `void'
+     whenever the value isn't useful.
+
+   * Assuming (for optimization) that the address of an external symbol
+     is never zero.
+
+     This assumption is false on certain systems when `#pragma weak' is
+     used.
+
+   * Making `-fshort-enums' the default.
+
+     This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other
+     C compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you
+     can get the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters
+     most is when the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure,
+     and in that case you can specify a field width explicitly.
+
+   * Making bitfields unsigned by default on particular machines where
+     "the ABI standard" says to do so.
+
+     The ANSI C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a
+     bitfield declared plain `int' is signed or not.  This in effect
+     creates two alternative dialects of C.
+
+     The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the
+     signed dialect with `-fsigned-bitfields' and the unsigned dialect
+     with `-funsigned-bitfields'.  However, this leaves open the
+     question of which dialect to use by default.
+
+     Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bitfields signed,
+     because this is simplest.  Since `int' is the same as `signed int'
+     in every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in
+     bitfields as well.
+
+     Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary
+     Interface standards which specify that plain bitfields should be
+     unsigned.  It is a mistake, however, to say anything about this
+     issue in an ABI.  This is because the handling of plain bitfields
+     distinguishes two dialects of C.  Both dialects are meaningful on
+     every type of machine.  Whether a particular object file was
+     compiled using signed bitfields or unsigned is of no concern to
+     other object files, even if they access the same bitfields in the
+     same data structures.
+
+     A given program is written in one or the other of these two
+     dialects.  The program stands a chance to work on most any machine
+     if it is compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work
+     at all if compiled with the wrong dialect.
+
+     Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
+     environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
+     inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bitfields differently
+     on certain machines.
+
+     Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular
+     machine type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the
+     GNU C compiler were to support by default the same dialect as the
+     other compilers on that machine.  But such applications are rare.
+     And users writing a program to run on more than one type of
+     machine cannot possibly benefit from this kind of compatibility.
+
+     This is why GCC does and will treat plain bitfields in the same
+     fashion on all types of machines (by default).
+
+     There are some arguments for making bitfields unsigned by default
+     on all machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de
+     facto standard, it would make sense for GCC to go along with it.
+     This is something to be considered in the future.
+
+     (Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should
+     indicate explicitly in each bitfield whether it is signed or not.
+     In this way, they write programs which have the same meaning in
+     both C dialects.)
+
+   * Undefining `__STDC__' when `-ansi' is not used.
+
+     Currently, GCC defines `__STDC__' as long as you don't use
+     `-traditional'.  This provides good results in practice.
+
+     Programmers normally use conditionals on `__STDC__' to ask whether
+     it is safe to use certain features of ANSI C, such as function
+     prototypes or ANSI token concatenation.  Since plain `gcc' supports
+     all the features of ANSI C, the correct answer to these questions
+     is "yes".
+
+     Some users try to use `__STDC__' to check for the availability of
+     certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in
+     an ANSI C program, because the ANSI C standard says that a
+     conforming freestanding implementation should define `__STDC__'
+     even though it does not have the library facilities.  `gcc -ansi
+     -pedantic' is a conforming freestanding implementation, and it is
+     therefore required to define `__STDC__', even though it does not
+     come with an ANSI C library.
+
+     Sometimes people say that defining `__STDC__' in a compiler that
+     does not completely conform to the ANSI C standard somehow
+     violates the standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a
+     standard for compilers that claim to support ANSI C, such as `gcc
+     -ansi'--not for other compilers such as plain `gcc'.  Whatever the
+     ANSI C standard says is relevant to the design of plain `gcc'
+     without `-ansi' only for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.
+
+     GCC normally defines `__STDC__' to be 1, and in addition defines
+     `__STRICT_ANSI__' if you specify the `-ansi' option.  On some
+     hosts, system include files use a different convention, where
+     `__STDC__' is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
+     conformance to the C Standard.  GCC follows the host convention
+     when processing system include files, but when processing user
+     files it follows the usual GNU C convention.
+
+   * Undefining `__STDC__' in C++.
+
+     Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
+     value of `__STDC__' that goes with the C compiler that is
+     subsequently used.  These programs must test `__STDC__' to
+     determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses: whether
+     they should concatenate tokens in the ANSI C fashion or in the
+     traditional fashion.
+
+     These programs work properly with GNU C++ if `__STDC__' is defined.
+     They would not work otherwise.
+
+     In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes
+     in ANSI C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files
+     can work without change in C++ provided `__STDC__' is defined.  If
+     `__STDC__' is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need
+     to be changed to test explicitly for C++ as well.
+
+   * Deleting "empty" loops.
+
+     Historically, GCC has not deleted "empty" loops under the
+     assumption that the most likely reason you would put one in a
+     program is to have a delay, so deleting them will not make real
+     programs run any faster.
+
+     However, the rationale here is that optimization of a nonempty loop
+     cannot produce an empty one, which holds for C but is not always
+     the case for C++.
+
+     Moreover, with `-funroll-loops' small "empty" loops are already
+     removed, so the current behavior is both sub-optimal and
+     inconsistent and will change in the future.
+
+   * Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other
+     compiler.
+
+     It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side
+     effects.  For example, a function call like this may very well
+     behave differently from one compiler to another:
+
+          void func (int, int);
+          
+          int i = 2;
+          func (i++, i++);
+
+     There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
+     definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any
+     particular order.  Either increment might happen first.  `func'
+     might get the arguments `2, 3', or it might get `3, 2', or even
+     `2, 2'.
+
+   * Not allowing structures with volatile fields in registers.
+
+     Strictly speaking, there is no prohibition in the ANSI C standard
+     against allowing structures with volatile fields in registers, but
+     it does not seem to make any sense and is probably not what you
+     wanted to do.  So the compiler will give an error message in this
+     case.

+
+Warning Messages and Error Messages
+===================================
+
+   The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
+warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:
+
+     *Errors* report problems that make it impossible to compile your
+     program.  GCC reports errors with the source file name and line
+     number where the problem is apparent.
+
+     *Warnings* report other unusual conditions in your code that *may*
+     indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does) proceed.
+     Warning messages also report the source file name and line number,
+     but include the text `warning:' to distinguish them from error
+     messages.
+
+   Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make
+sure that your program really does what you intend; or the use of
+obsolete features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.
+Many warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the `-W'
+options (for instance, `-Wall' requests a variety of useful warnings).
+
+   GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
+gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
+(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
+however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
+forbidden, and a diagnostic *must* be issued by a conforming compiler.
+The `-pedantic' option tells GCC to issue warnings in such cases;
+`-pedantic-errors' says to make them errors instead.  This does not
+mean that *all* non-ANSI constructs get warnings or errors.
+
+   *Note Options to Request or Suppress Warnings: Warning Options, for
+more detail on these and related command-line options.

+   When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it
+is already known.  *Note Trouble::.  If it isn't known, then you should
+report the problem.
+
+   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
+or it may not.  (If it does not, look in the service directory; see
+*Note Service::.)  In any case, the principal function of a bug report
+is to help the entire community by making the next version of GCC work
+better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of GCC.
+
+   Since the maintainers are very overloaded, we cannot respond to every
+bug report.  However, if the bug has not been fixed, we are likely to
+send you a patch and ask you to tell us whether it works.
+
+   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the

+
+Have You Found a Bug?
+=====================
+
+   If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
+guidelines:
+
+   * If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
+     is a compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.
+
+   * If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input
+     whatever (except an `asm' statement), that is a compiler bug,
+     unless the compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would
+     ordinarily prevent the assembler from being run.
+
+   * If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not
+     correctly execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.
+
+     However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have
+     run into an incompatibility between GNU C and traditional C (*note
+     Incompatibilities::.).  These incompatibilities might be considered
+     bugs, but they are inescapable consequences of valuable features.
+
+     Or you may have a program whose behavior is undefined, which
+     happened by chance to give the desired results with another C or
+     C++ compiler.
+
+     For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write `x;'
+     at the end of a function instead of `return x;', with the same
+     results.  But the value of the function is undefined if `return'
+     is omitted; it is not a bug when GCC produces different results.
+
+     Problems often result from expressions with two increment
+     operators, as in `f (*p++, *p++)'.  Your previous compiler might
+     have interpreted that expression the way you intended; GCC might
+     interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
+     in your code.
+
+     After you have localized the error to a single source line, it
+     should be easy to check for these things.  If your program is
+     correct and well defined, you have found a compiler bug.
+
+   * If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is
+     a compiler bug.
+
+   * If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid
+     input, that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your
+     idea of "invalid input" might be my idea of "an extension" or
+     "support for traditional practice".
+
+   * If you are an experienced user of C or C++ (or Fortran or
+     Objective-C) compilers, your suggestions for improvement of GCC
+     are welcome in any case.

+Where to Report Bugs
+====================
+
+   Send bug reports for the GNU Compiler Collection to
+`gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org'.  In accordance with the GNU-wide convention, in
+which bug reports for tool "foo" are sent to `bug-foo@gnu.org', the
+address `bug-gcc@gnu.org' may also be used; it will forward to the
+address given above.
+
+   Please read
+`<URL:http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/faq.html#bugreport>' for bug
+reporting instructions before you post a bug report.
+
+   Often people think of posting bug reports to the newsgroup instead of
+mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one problem which can be
+crucial: a newsgroup posting does not contain a mail path back to the
+sender.  Thus, if maintainers need more information, they may be unable
+to reach you.  For this reason, you should always send bug reports by
+mail to the proper mailing list.
+
+   As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:

+
+How to Report Bugs
+==================
+
+   You may find additional and/or more up-to-date instructions at
+`<URL:http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/faq.html#bugreport>'.
+
+   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
+*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
+leave it out, state it!
+
+   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
+problem and they conclude that some details don't matter.  Thus, you
+might assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does
+not matter.  Well, probably it doesn't, but one cannot be sure.
+Perhaps the bug is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from
+the location where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name
+were different, the contents of that location would fool the compiler
+into doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
+specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
+and the most helpful.
+
+   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
+fix the bug if it is not known.  It isn't very important what happens if
+the bug is already known.  Therefore, always write your bug reports on
+the assumption that the bug is not known.
+
+   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
+bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
+respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.  You
+might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.
+
+   Try to make your bug report self-contained.  If we have to ask you
+for more information, it is best if you include all the previous
+information in your response, as well as the information that was
+missing.
+
+   Please report each bug in a separate message.  This makes it easier
+for us to track which bugs have been fixed and to forward your bugs
+reports to the appropriate maintainer.
+
+   To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all
+these things:
+
+   * The version of GCC.  You can get this by running it with the `-v'
+     option.
+
+     Without this, we won't know whether there is any point in looking
+     for the bug in the current version of GCC.
+
+   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
+     in the C preprocessor, send a source file and any header files
+     that it requires.  If the bug is in the compiler proper (`cc1'),
+     send the preprocessor output generated by adding `-save-temps' to
+     the compilation command (*note Debugging Options::.).  When you do
+     this, use the same `-I', `-D' or `-U' options that you used in
+     actual compilation. Then send the INPUT.i or INPUT.ii files
+     generated.
+
+     A single statement is not enough of an example.  In order to
+     compile it, it must be embedded in a complete file of compiler
+     input; and the bug might depend on the details of how this is done.
+
+     Without a real example one can compile, all anyone can do about
+     your bug report is wish you luck.  It would be futile to try to
+     guess how to provoke the bug.  For example, bugs in register
+     allocation and reloading frequently depend on every little detail
+     of the function they happen in.
+
+     Even if the input file that fails comes from a GNU program, you
+     should still send the complete test case.  Don't ask the GCC
+     maintainers to do the extra work of obtaining the program in
+     question--they are all overworked as it is.  Also, the problem may
+     depend on what is in the header files on your system; it is
+     unreliable for the GCC maintainers to try the problem with the
+     header files available to them.  By sending CPP output, you can
+     eliminate this source of uncertainty and save us a certain
+     percentage of wild goose chases.
+
+   * The command arguments you gave GCC to compile that example and
+     observe the bug.  For example, did you use `-O'?  To guarantee you
+     won't omit something important, list all the options.
+
+     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
+     wrong and then we would not encounter the bug.
+
+   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
+     and version number.
+
+   * The operands you gave to the `configure' command when you installed
+     the compiler.
+
+   * A complete list of any modifications you have made to the compiler
+     source.  (We don't promise to investigate the bug unless it
+     happens in an unmodified compiler.  But if you've made
+     modifications and don't tell us, then you are sending us on a wild
+     goose chase.)
+
+     Be precise about these changes.  A description in English is not
+     enough--send a context diff for them.
+
+     Adding files of your own (such as a machine description for a
+     machine we don't support) is a modification of the compiler source.
+
+   * Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for
+     installing GCC.
+
+   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
+     incorrect.  For example, "The compiler gets a fatal signal," or,
+     "The assembler instruction at line 208 in the output is incorrect."
+
+     Of course, if the bug is that the compiler gets a fatal signal,
+     then one can't miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, the
+     maintainer might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  None of
+     us has time to study all the assembler code from a 50-line C
+     program just on the chance that one instruction might be wrong.
+     We need *you* to do this part!
+
+     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
+     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
+     such as, your copy of the compiler is out of synch, or you have
+     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has
+     happened!)  Your copy might crash and the copy here would not.  If
+     you said to expect a crash, then when the compiler here fails to
+     crash, we would know that the bug was not happening.  If you don't
+     say to expect a crash, then we would not know whether the bug was
+     happening.  We would not be able to draw any conclusion from our
+     observations.
+
+     If the problem is a diagnostic when compiling GCC with some other
+     compiler, say whether it is a warning or an error.
+
+     Often the observed symptom is incorrect output when your program
+     is run.  Sad to say, this is not enough information unless the
+     program is short and simple.  None of us has time to study a large
+     program to figure out how it would work if compiled correctly,
+     much less which line of it was compiled wrong.  So you will have
+     to do that.  Tell us which source line it is, and what incorrect
+     result happens when that line is executed.  A person who
+     understands the program can find this as easily as finding a bug
+     in the program itself.
+
+   * If you send examples of assembler code output from GCC, please use
+     `-g' when you make them.  The debugging information includes
+     source line numbers which are essential for correlating the output
+     with the input.
+
+   * If you wish to mention something in the GCC source, refer to it by
+     context, not by line number.
+
+     The line numbers in the development sources don't match those in
+     your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
+     information to the maintainers.
+
+   * Additional information from a debugger might enable someone to
+     find a problem on a machine which he does not have available.
+     However, you need to think when you collect this information if
+     you want it to have any chance of being useful.
+
+     For example, many people send just a backtrace, but that is never
+     useful by itself.  A simple backtrace with arguments conveys little
+     about GCC because the compiler is largely data-driven; the same
+     functions are called over and over for different RTL insns, doing
+     different things depending on the details of the insn.
+
+     Most of the arguments listed in the backtrace are useless because
+     they are pointers to RTL list structure.  The numeric values of the
+     pointers, which the debugger prints in the backtrace, have no
+     significance whatever; all that matters is the contents of the
+     objects they point to (and most of the contents are other such
+     pointers).
+
+     In addition, most compiler passes consist of one or more loops that
+     scan the RTL insn sequence.  The most vital piece of information
+     about such a loop--which insn it has reached--is usually in a
+     local variable, not in an argument.
+
+     What you need to provide in addition to a backtrace are the values
+     of the local variables for several stack frames up.  When a local
+     variable or an argument is an RTX, first print its value and then
+     use the GDB command `pr' to print the RTL expression that it points
+     to.  (If GDB doesn't run on your machine, use your debugger to call
+     the function `debug_rtx' with the RTX as an argument.)  In
+     general, whenever a variable is a pointer, its value is no use
+     without the data it points to.
+
+   Here are some things that are not necessary:
+
+   * A description of the envelope of the bug.
+
+     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
+     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
+     changes will not affect it.
+
+     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
+     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
+     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
+     examples.  You might as well save your time for something else.
+
+     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report *instead* of
+     the original one, that is a convenience.  Errors in the output
+     will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take less
+     time, etc.  Most GCC bugs involve just one function, so the most
+     straightforward way to simplify an example is to delete all the
+     function definitions except the one where the bug occurs.  Those
+     earlier in the file may be replaced by external declarations if
+     the crucial function depends on them.  (Exception: inline
+     functions may affect compilation of functions defined later in the
+     file.)
+
+     However, simplification is not vital; if you don't want to do this,
+     report the bug anyway and send the entire test case you used.
+
+   * In particular, some people insert conditionals `#ifdef BUG' around
+     a statement which, if removed, makes the bug not happen.  These
+     are just clutter; we won't pay any attention to them anyway.
+     Besides, you should send us cpp output, and that can't have
+     conditionals.
+
+   * A patch for the bug.
+
+     A patch for the bug is useful if it is a good one.  But don't omit
+     the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
+     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
+     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
+     might not understand it at all.
+
+     Sometimes with a program as complicated as GCC it is very hard to
+     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
+     path through the code.  If you don't send the example, we won't be
+     able to construct one, so we won't be able to verify that the bug
+     is fixed.
+
+     And if we can't understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
+     your patch should be an improvement, we won't install it.  A test
+     case will help us to understand.
+
+     *Note Sending Patches::, for guidelines on how to make it easy for
+     us to understand and install your patches.
+
+   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.
+
+     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even I can't guess right about
+     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.
+
+   * A core dump file.
+
+     We have no way of examining a core dump for your type of machine
+     unless we have an identical system--and if we do have one, we
+     should be able to reproduce the crash ourselves.

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Sending Patches,  Prev: Bug Reporting,  Up: Bugs
+
+Sending Patches for GCC
+=======================
+
+   If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for the GNU C
+compiler, that is very helpful.  Send suggested fixes to the patches
+mailing list, `gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org'.
+
+   Please follow these guidelines so we can study your patches
+efficiently.  If you don't follow these guidelines, your information
+might still be useful, but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining
+GNU C is a lot of work in the best of circumstances, and we can't keep
+up unless you do your best to help.
+
+   * Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or
+     what improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a
+     copy of the bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.
+
+     (Referring to a bug report is not as good as including it, because
+     then we will have to look it up, and we have probably already
+     deleted it if we've already fixed the bug.)
+
+   * Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you
+     have fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is
+     right before installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have
+     trouble judging it if we don't have a way to reproduce the problem.
+
+   * Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people
+     reading the source in the future understand why this change was
+     needed.
+
+   * Don't mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
+     *individually*.
+
+     If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not
+     want to install them both.  We might want to install just one.  If
+     you send them all jumbled together in a single set of diffs, we
+     have to do extra work to disentangle them--to figure out which
+     parts of the change serve which purpose.  If we don't have time
+     for this, we might have to ignore your changes entirely.
+
+     If you send each change as soon as you have written it, with its
+     own explanation, then the two changes never get tangled up, and we
+     can consider each one properly without any extra work to
+     disentangle them.
+
+     Ideally, each change you send should be impossible to subdivide
+     into parts that we might want to consider separately, because each
+     of its parts gets its motivation from the other parts.
+
+   * Send each change as soon as that change is finished.  Sometimes
+     people think they are helping us by accumulating many changes to
+     send them all together.  As explained above, this is absolutely
+     the worst thing you could do.
+
+     Since you should send each change separately, you might as well
+     send it right away.  That gives us the option of installing it
+     immediately if it is important.
+
+   * Use `diff -c' to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
+     for us to install reliably.  More than that, they make it hard for
+     us to study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them.
+     Unidiff format is better than contextless diffs, but not as easy
+     to read as `-c' format.
+
+     If you have GNU diff, use `diff -cp', which shows the name of the
+     function that each change occurs in.
+
+   * Write the change log entries for your changes.  We get lots of
+     changes, and we don't have time to do all the change log writing
+     ourselves.
+
+     Read the `ChangeLog' file to see what sorts of information to put
+     in, and to learn the style that we use.  The purpose of the change
+     log is to show people where to find what was changed.  So you need
+     to be specific about what functions you changed; in large
+     functions, it's often helpful to indicate where within the
+     function the change was.
+
+     On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the
+     change, you need not explain its purpose.  Thus, if you add a new
+     function, all you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you
+     feel that the purpose needs explaining, it probably does--but the
+     explanation will be much more useful if you put it in comments in
+     the code.
+
+     If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who
+     made the change, send us the header line.
+
+   * When you write the fix, keep in mind that we can't install a
+     change that would break other systems.
+
+     People often suggest fixing a problem by changing
+     machine-independent files such as `toplev.c' to do something
+     special that a particular system needs.  Sometimes it is totally
+     obvious that such changes would break GCC for almost all users.
+     We can't possibly make a change like that.  At best it might tell
+     us how to write another patch that would solve the problem
+     acceptably.
+
+     Sometimes people send fixes that *might* be an improvement in
+     general--but it is hard to be sure of this.  It's hard to install
+     such changes because we have to study them very carefully.  Of
+     course, a good explanation of the reasoning by which you concluded
+     the change was correct can help convince us.
+
+     The safest changes are changes to the configuration files for a
+     particular machine.  These are safe because they can't create new
+     bugs on other machines.
+
+     Please help us keep up with the workload by designing the patch in
+     a form that is good to install.

+
+   If you need help installing, using or changing GCC, there are two
+ways to find it:
+
+   * Send a message to a suitable network mailing list.  First try
+     `gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org' or `bug-gcc@gnu.org', and if that brings no
+     response, try `gcc@gcc.gnu.org'.
+
+   * Look in the service directory for someone who might help you for a
+     fee.  The service directory is found in the file named `SERVICE'
+     in the GCC distribution.

+
+Include Files and VMS
+=====================
+
+   Due to the differences between the filesystems of Unix and VMS, GCC
+attempts to translate file names in `#include' into names that VMS will
+understand.  The basic strategy is to prepend a prefix to the
+specification of the include file, convert the whole filename to a VMS
+filename, and then try to open the file.  GCC tries various prefixes
+one by one until one of them succeeds:
+
+  1. The first prefix is the `GNU_CC_INCLUDE:' logical name: this is
+     where GNU C header files are traditionally stored.  If you wish to
+     store header files in non-standard locations, then you can assign
+     the logical `GNU_CC_INCLUDE' to be a search list, where each
+     element of the list is suitable for use with a rooted logical.
+
+  2. The next prefix tried is `SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]'.  This is where
+     VAX-C header files are traditionally stored.
+
+  3. If the include file specification by itself is a valid VMS
+     filename, the preprocessor then uses this name with no prefix in
+     an attempt to open the include file.
+
+  4. If the file specification is not a valid VMS filename (i.e. does
+     not contain a device or a directory specifier, and contains a `/'
+     character), the preprocessor tries to convert it from Unix syntax
+     to VMS syntax.
+
+     Conversion works like this: the first directory name becomes a
+     device, and the rest of the directories are converted into
+     VMS-format directory names.  For example, the name `X11/foobar.h'
+     is translated to `X11:[000000]foobar.h' or `X11:foobar.h',
+     whichever one can be opened.  This strategy allows you to assign a
+     logical name to point to the actual location of the header files.
+
+  5. If none of these strategies succeeds, the `#include' fails.
+
+   Include directives of the form:
+
+     #include foobar
+
+are a common source of incompatibility between VAX-C and GCC.  VAX-C
+treats this much like a standard `#include <foobar.h>' directive.  That
+is incompatible with the ANSI C behavior implemented by GCC: to expand
+the name `foobar' as a macro.  Macro expansion should eventually yield
+one of the two standard formats for `#include':
+
+     #include "FILE"
+     #include <FILE>
+
+   If you have this problem, the best solution is to modify the source
+to convert the `#include' directives to one of the two standard forms.
+That will work with either compiler.  If you want a quick and dirty fix,
+define the file names as macros with the proper expansion, like this:
+
+     #define stdio <stdio.h>
+
+This will work, as long as the name doesn't conflict with anything else
+in the program.
+
+   Another source of incompatibility is that VAX-C assumes that:
+
+     #include "foobar"
+
+is actually asking for the file `foobar.h'.  GCC does not make this
+assumption, and instead takes what you ask for literally; it tries to
+read the file `foobar'.  The best way to avoid this problem is to
+always specify the desired file extension in your include directives.
+
+   GCC for VMS is distributed with a set of include files that is
+sufficient to compile most general purpose programs.  Even though the
+GCC distribution does not contain header files to define constants and
+structures for some VMS system-specific functions, there is no reason
+why you cannot use GCC with any of these functions.  You first may have
+to generate or create header files, either by using the public domain
+utility `UNSDL' (which can be found on a DECUS tape), or by extracting
+the relevant modules from one of the system macro libraries, and using
+an editor to construct a C header file.
+
+   A `#include' file name cannot contain a DECNET node name.  The
+preprocessor reports an I/O error if you attempt to use a node name,
+whether explicitly, or implicitly via a logical name.

+
+Global Declarations and VMS
+===========================
+
+   GCC does not provide the `globalref', `globaldef' and `globalvalue'
+keywords of VAX-C.  You can get the same effect with an obscure feature
+of GAS, the GNU assembler.  (This requires GAS version 1.39 or later.)
+The following macros allow you to use this feature in a fairly natural
+way:
+
+     #ifdef __GNUC__
+     #define GLOBALREF(TYPE,NAME)                      \
+       TYPE NAME                                       \
+       asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL$$" #NAME)
+     #define GLOBALDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE)                \
+       TYPE NAME                                       \
+       asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL$$" #NAME) \
+         = VALUE
+     #define GLOBALVALUEREF(TYPE,NAME)                 \
+       const TYPE NAME[1]                              \
+       asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALVALUE$$" #NAME)
+     #define GLOBALVALUEDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE)           \
+       const TYPE NAME[1]                              \
+       asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALVALUE$$" #NAME)  \
+         = {VALUE}
+     #else
+     #define GLOBALREF(TYPE,NAME) \
+       globalref TYPE NAME
+     #define GLOBALDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE) \
+       globaldef TYPE NAME = VALUE
+     #define GLOBALVALUEDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE) \
+       globalvalue TYPE NAME = VALUE
+     #define GLOBALVALUEREF(TYPE,NAME) \
+       globalvalue TYPE NAME
+     #endif
+
+(The `_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL' prefix at the start of the name
+is removed by the assembler, after it has modified the attributes of
+the symbol).  These macros are provided in the VMS binaries
+distribution in a header file `GNU_HACKS.H'.  An example of the usage
+is:
+
+     GLOBALREF (int, ijk);
+     GLOBALDEF (int, jkl, 0);
+
+   The macros `GLOBALREF' and `GLOBALDEF' cannot be used
+straightforwardly for arrays, since there is no way to insert the array
+dimension into the declaration at the right place.  However, you can
+declare an array with these macros if you first define a typedef for the
+array type, like this:
+
+     typedef int intvector[10];
+     GLOBALREF (intvector, foo);
+
+   Array and structure initializers will also break the macros; you can
+define the initializer to be a macro of its own, or you can expand the
+`GLOBALDEF' macro by hand.  You may find a case where you wish to use
+the `GLOBALDEF' macro with a large array, but you are not interested in
+explicitly initializing each element of the array.  In such cases you
+can use an initializer like: `{0,}', which will initialize the entire
+array to `0'.
+
+   A shortcoming of this implementation is that a variable declared with
+`GLOBALVALUEREF' or `GLOBALVALUEDEF' is always an array.  For example,
+the declaration:
+
+     GLOBALVALUEREF(int, ijk);
+
+declares the variable `ijk' as an array of type `int [1]'.  This is
+done because a globalvalue is actually a constant; its "value" is what
+the linker would normally consider an address.  That is not how an
+integer value works in C, but it is how an array works.  So treating
+the symbol as an array name gives consistent results--with the
+exception that the value seems to have the wrong type.  *Don't try to
+access an element of the array.*  It doesn't have any elements.  The
+array "address" may not be the address of actual storage.
+
+   The fact that the symbol is an array may lead to warnings where the
+variable is used.  Insert type casts to avoid the warnings.  Here is an
+example; it takes advantage of the ANSI C feature allowing macros that
+expand to use the same name as the macro itself.
+
+     GLOBALVALUEREF (int, ss$_normal);
+     GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, xyzzy,123);
+     #ifdef __GNUC__
+     #define ss$_normal ((int) ss$_normal)
+     #define xyzzy ((int) xyzzy)
+     #endif
+
+   Don't use `globaldef' or `globalref' with a variable whose type is
+an enumeration type; this is not implemented.  Instead, make the
+variable an integer, and use a `globalvaluedef' for each of the
+enumeration values.  An example of this would be:
+
+     #ifdef __GNUC__
+     GLOBALDEF (int, color, 0);
+     GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, RED, 0);
+     GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, BLUE, 1);
+     GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, GREEN, 3);
+     #else
+     enum globaldef color {RED, BLUE, GREEN = 3};
+     #endif

+
+Other VMS Issues
+================
+
+   GCC automatically arranges for `main' to return 1 by default if you
+fail to specify an explicit return value.  This will be interpreted by
+VMS as a status code indicating a normal successful completion.
+Version 1 of GCC did not provide this default.
+
+   GCC on VMS works only with the GNU assembler, GAS.  You need version
+1.37 or later of GAS in order to produce value debugging information for
+the VMS debugger.  Use the ordinary VMS linker with the object files
+produced by GAS.
+
+   Under previous versions of GCC, the generated code would occasionally
+give strange results when linked to the sharable `VAXCRTL' library.
+Now this should work.
+
+   A caveat for use of `const' global variables: the `const' modifier
+must be specified in every external declaration of the variable in all
+of the source files that use that variable.  Otherwise the linker will
+issue warnings about conflicting attributes for the variable.  Your
+program will still work despite the warnings, but the variable will be
+placed in writable storage.
+
+   Although the VMS linker does distinguish between upper and lower case
+letters in global symbols, most VMS compilers convert all such symbols
+into upper case and most run-time library routines also have upper case
+names.  To be able to reliably call such routines, GCC (by means of the
+assembler GAS) converts global symbols into upper case like other VMS
+compilers.  However, since the usual practice in C is to distinguish
+case, GCC (via GAS) tries to preserve usual C behavior by augmenting
+each name that is not all lower case.  This means truncating the name
+to at most 23 characters and then adding more characters at the end
+which encode the case pattern of those 23.   Names which contain at
+least one dollar sign are an exception; they are converted directly into
+upper case without augmentation.
+
+   Name augmentation yields bad results for programs that use
+precompiled libraries (such as Xlib) which were generated by another
+compiler.  You can use the compiler option `/NOCASE_HACK' to inhibit
+augmentation; it makes external C functions and variables
+case-independent as is usual on VMS.  Alternatively, you could write
+all references to the functions and variables in such libraries using
+lower case; this will work on VMS, but is not portable to other
+systems.  The compiler option `/NAMES' also provides control over
+global name handling.
+
+   Function and variable names are handled somewhat differently with GNU
+C++.  The GNU C++ compiler performs "name mangling" on function names,
+which means that it adds information to the function name to describe
+the data types of the arguments that the function takes.  One result of
+this is that the name of a function can become very long.  Since the
+VMS linker only recognizes the first 31 characters in a name, special
+action is taken to ensure that each function and variable has a unique
+name that can be represented in 31 characters.
+
+   If the name (plus a name augmentation, if required) is less than 32
+characters in length, then no special action is performed.  If the name
+is longer than 31 characters, the assembler (GAS) will generate a hash
+string based upon the function name, truncate the function name to 23
+characters, and append the hash string to the truncated name.  If the
+`/VERBOSE' compiler option is used, the assembler will print both the
+full and truncated names of each symbol that is truncated.
+
+   The `/NOCASE_HACK' compiler option should not be used when you are
+compiling programs that use libg++.  libg++ has several instances of
+objects (i.e.  `Filebuf' and `filebuf') which become indistinguishable
+in a case-insensitive environment.  This leads to cases where you need
+to inhibit augmentation selectively (if you were using libg++ and Xlib
+in the same program, for example).  There is no special feature for
+doing this, but you can get the result by defining a macro for each
+mixed case symbol for which you wish to inhibit augmentation.  The
+macro should expand into the lower case equivalent of itself.  For
+example:
+
+     #define StuDlyCapS studlycaps
+
+   These macro definitions can be placed in a header file to minimize
+the number of changes to your source code.

+GCC and Portability
+*******************
+
+   The main goal of GCC was to make a good, fast compiler for machines
+in the class that the GNU system aims to run on: 32-bit machines that
+address 8-bit bytes and have several general registers.  Elegance,
+theoretical power and simplicity are only secondary.
+
+   GCC gets most of the information about the target machine from a
+machine description which gives an algebraic formula for each of the
+machine's instructions.  This is a very clean way to describe the
+target.  But when the compiler needs information that is difficult to
+express in this fashion, I have not hesitated to define an ad-hoc
+parameter to the machine description.  The purpose of portability is to
+reduce the total work needed on the compiler; it was not of interest
+for its own sake.
+
+   GCC does not contain machine dependent code, but it does contain code
+that depends on machine parameters such as endianness (whether the most
+significant byte has the highest or lowest address of the bytes in a
+word) and the availability of autoincrement addressing.  In the
+RTL-generation pass, it is often necessary to have multiple strategies
+for generating code for a particular kind of syntax tree, strategies
+that are usable for different combinations of parameters.  Often I have
+not tried to address all possible cases, but only the common ones or
+only the ones that I have encountered.  As a result, a new target may
+require additional strategies.  You will know if this happens because
+the compiler will call `abort'.  Fortunately, the new strategies can be
+added in a machine-independent fashion, and will affect only the target
+machines that need them.

+
+Interfacing to GCC Output
+*************************
+
+   GCC is normally configured to use the same function calling
+convention normally in use on the target system.  This is done with the
+machine-description macros described (*note Target Macros::.).
+
+   However, returning of structure and union values is done differently
+on some target machines.  As a result, functions compiled with PCC
+returning such types cannot be called from code compiled with GCC, and
+vice versa.  This does not cause trouble often because few Unix library
+routines return structures or unions.
+
+   GCC code returns structures and unions that are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes
+long in the same registers used for `int' or `double' return values.
+(GCC typically allocates variables of such types in registers also.)
+Structures and unions of other sizes are returned by storing them into
+an address passed by the caller (usually in a register).  The
+machine-description macros `STRUCT_VALUE' and `STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE'
+tell GCC where to pass this address.
+
+   By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and
+unions of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage,
+and then returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer
+value.  The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the
+place where the value is wanted.  This is slower than the method used
+by GCC, and fails to be reentrant.
+
+   On some target machines, such as RISC machines and the 80386, the
+standard system convention is to pass to the subroutine the address of
+where to return the value.  On these machines, GCC has been configured
+to be compatible with the standard compiler, when this method is used.
+It may not be compatible for structures of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
+
+   GCC uses the system's standard convention for passing arguments.  On
+some machines, the first few arguments are passed in registers; in
+others, all are passed on the stack.  It would be possible to use
+registers for argument passing on any machine, and this would probably
+result in a significant speedup.  But the result would be complete
+incompatibility with code that follows the standard convention.  So this
+change is practical only if you are switching to GCC as the sole C
+compiler for the system.  We may implement register argument passing on
+certain machines once we have a complete GNU system so that we can
+compile the libraries with GCC.
+
+   On some machines (particularly the Sparc), certain types of arguments
+are passed "by invisible reference".  This means that the value is
+stored in memory, and the address of the memory location is passed to
+the subroutine.
+
+   If you use `longjmp', beware of automatic variables.  ANSI C says
+that automatic variables that are not declared `volatile' have undefined
+values after a `longjmp'.  And this is all GCC promises to do, because
+it is very difficult to restore register variables correctly, and one
+of GCC's features is that it can put variables in registers without
+your asking it to.
+
+   If you want a variable to be unaltered by `longjmp', and you don't
+want to write `volatile' because old C compilers don't accept it, just
+take the address of the variable.  If a variable's address is ever
+taken, even if just to compute it and ignore it, then the variable
+cannot go in a register:
+
+     {
+       int careful;
+       &careful;
+       ...
+     }
+
+   Code compiled with GCC may call certain library routines.  Most of
+them handle arithmetic for which there are no instructions.  This
+includes multiply and divide on some machines, and floating point
+operations on any machine for which floating point support is disabled
+with `-msoft-float'.  Some standard parts of the C library, such as
+`bcopy' or `memcpy', are also called automatically.  The usual function
+call interface is used for calling the library routines.
+
+   These library routines should be defined in the library `libgcc.a',
+which GCC automatically searches whenever it links a program.  On
+machines that have multiply and divide instructions, if hardware
+floating point is in use, normally `libgcc.a' is not needed, but it is
+searched just in case.
+
+   Each arithmetic function is defined in `libgcc1.c' to use the
+corresponding C arithmetic operator.  As long as the file is compiled
+with another C compiler, which supports all the C arithmetic operators,
+this file will work portably.  However, `libgcc1.c' does not work if
+compiled with GCC, because each arithmetic function would compile into
+a call to itself!

+
+Passes and Files of the Compiler
+********************************
+
+   The overall control structure of the compiler is in `toplev.c'.  This
+file is responsible for initialization, decoding arguments, opening and
+closing files, and sequencing the passes.
+
+   The parsing pass is invoked only once, to parse the entire input.
+The RTL intermediate code for a function is generated as the function
+is parsed, a statement at a time.  Each statement is read in as a
+syntax tree and then converted to RTL; then the storage for the tree
+for the statement is reclaimed.  Storage for types (and the expressions
+for their sizes), declarations, and a representation of the binding
+contours and how they nest, remain until the function is finished being
+compiled; these are all needed to output the debugging information.
+
+   Each time the parsing pass reads a complete function definition or
+top-level declaration, it calls either the function
+`rest_of_compilation', or the function `rest_of_decl_compilation' in
+`toplev.c', which are responsible for all further processing necessary,
+ending with output of the assembler language.  All other compiler
+passes run, in sequence, within `rest_of_compilation'.  When that
+function returns from compiling a function definition, the storage used
+for that function definition's compilation is entirely freed, unless it
+is an inline function (*note An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro:
+Inline.).
+
+   Here is a list of all the passes of the compiler and their source
+files.  Also included is a description of where debugging dumps can be
+requested with `-d' options.
+
+   * Parsing.  This pass reads the entire text of a function definition,
+     constructing partial syntax trees.  This and RTL generation are no
+     longer truly separate passes (formerly they were), but it is
+     easier to think of them as separate.
+
+     The tree representation does not entirely follow C syntax, because
+     it is intended to support other languages as well.
+
+     Language-specific data type analysis is also done in this pass,
+     and every tree node that represents an expression has a data type
+     attached.  Variables are represented as declaration nodes.
+
+     Constant folding and some arithmetic simplifications are also done
+     during this pass.
+
+     The language-independent source files for parsing are
+     `stor-layout.c', `fold-const.c', and `tree.c'.  There are also
+     header files `tree.h' and `tree.def' which define the format of
+     the tree representation.
+
+     The source files to parse C are `c-parse.in', `c-decl.c',
+     `c-typeck.c', `c-aux-info.c', `c-convert.c', and `c-lang.c' along
+     with header files `c-lex.h', and `c-tree.h'.
+
+     The source files for parsing C++ are `cp-parse.y', `cp-class.c',
+     `cp-cvt.c', `cp-decl.c', `cp-decl2.c', `cp-dem.c', `cp-except.c',
+     `cp-expr.c', `cp-init.c', `cp-lex.c', `cp-method.c', `cp-ptree.c',
+     `cp-search.c', `cp-tree.c', `cp-type2.c', and `cp-typeck.c', along
+     with header files `cp-tree.def', `cp-tree.h', and `cp-decl.h'.
+
+     The special source files for parsing Objective C are
+     `objc-parse.y', `objc-actions.c', `objc-tree.def', and
+     `objc-actions.h'.  Certain C-specific files are used for this as
+     well.
+
+     The file `c-common.c' is also used for all of the above languages.
+
+   * RTL generation.  This is the conversion of syntax tree into RTL
+     code.  It is actually done statement-by-statement during parsing,
+     but for most purposes it can be thought of as a separate pass.
+
+     This is where the bulk of target-parameter-dependent code is found,
+     since often it is necessary for strategies to apply only when
+     certain standard kinds of instructions are available.  The purpose
+     of named instruction patterns is to provide this information to
+     the RTL generation pass.
+
+     Optimization is done in this pass for `if'-conditions that are
+     comparisons, boolean operations or conditional expressions.  Tail
+     recursion is detected at this time also.  Decisions are made about
+     how best to arrange loops and how to output `switch' statements.
+
+     The source files for RTL generation include `stmt.c', `calls.c',
+     `expr.c', `explow.c', `expmed.c', `function.c', `optabs.c' and
+     `emit-rtl.c'.  Also, the file `insn-emit.c', generated from the
+     machine description by the program `genemit', is used in this
+     pass.  The header file `expr.h' is used for communication within
+     this pass.
+
+     The header files `insn-flags.h' and `insn-codes.h', generated from
+     the machine description by the programs `genflags' and `gencodes',
+     tell this pass which standard names are available for use and
+     which patterns correspond to them.
+
+     Aside from debugging information output, none of the following
+     passes refers to the tree structure representation of the function
+     (only part of which is saved).
+
+     The decision of whether the function can and should be expanded
+     inline in its subsequent callers is made at the end of rtl
+     generation.  The function must meet certain criteria, currently
+     related to the size of the function and the types and number of
+     parameters it has.  Note that this function may contain loops,
+     recursive calls to itself (tail-recursive functions can be
+     inlined!), gotos, in short, all constructs supported by GCC.  The
+     file `integrate.c' contains the code to save a function's rtl for
+     later inlining and to inline that rtl when the function is called.
+     The header file `integrate.h' is also used for this purpose.
+
+     The option `-dr' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.rtl' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Jump optimization.  This pass simplifies jumps to the following
+     instruction, jumps across jumps, and jumps to jumps.  It deletes
+     unreferenced labels and unreachable code, except that unreachable
+     code that contains a loop is not recognized as unreachable in this
+     pass.  (Such loops are deleted later in the basic block analysis.)
+     It also converts some code originally written with jumps into
+     sequences of instructions that directly set values from the
+     results of comparisons, if the machine has such instructions.
+
+     Jump optimization is performed two or three times.  The first time
+     is immediately following RTL generation.  The second time is after
+     CSE, but only if CSE says repeated jump optimization is needed.
+     The last time is right before the final pass.  That time,
+     cross-jumping and deletion of no-op move instructions are done
+     together with the optimizations described above.
+
+     The source file of this pass is `jump.c'.
+
+     The option `-dj' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass is run for the first time.  This dump file's name is
+     made by appending `.jump' to the input file name.
+
+   * Register scan.  This pass finds the first and last use of each
+     register, as a guide for common subexpression elimination.  Its
+     source is in `regclass.c'.
+
+   * Jump threading.  This pass detects a condition jump that branches
+     to an identical or inverse test.  Such jumps can be `threaded'
+     through the second conditional test.  The source code for this
+     pass is in `jump.c'.  This optimization is only performed if
+     `-fthread-jumps' is enabled.
+
+   * Common subexpression elimination.  This pass also does constant
+     propagation.  Its source file is `cse.c'.  If constant propagation
+     causes conditional jumps to become unconditional or to become
+     no-ops, jump optimization is run again when CSE is finished.
+
+     The option `-ds' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.cse' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Global common subexpression elimination.  This pass performs GCSE
+     using Morel-Renvoise Partial Redundancy Elimination, with the
+     exception that it does not try to move invariants out of loops -
+     that is left to the loop optimization pass.  This pass also
+     performs global constant and copy propagation.
+
+     The source file for this pass is gcse.c.
+
+     The option `-dG' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.gcse' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Loop optimization.  This pass moves constant expressions out of
+     loops, and optionally does strength-reduction and loop unrolling
+     as well.  Its source files are `loop.c' and `unroll.c', plus the
+     header `loop.h' used for communication between them.  Loop
+     unrolling uses some functions in `integrate.c' and the header
+     `integrate.h'.
+
+     The option `-dL' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.loop' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * If `-frerun-cse-after-loop' was enabled, a second common
+     subexpression elimination pass is performed after the loop
+     optimization pass.  Jump threading is also done again at this time
+     if it was specified.
+
+     The option `-dt' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.cse2' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Stupid register allocation is performed at this point in a
+     nonoptimizing compilation.  It does a little data flow analysis as
+     well.  When stupid register allocation is in use, the next pass
+     executed is the reloading pass; the others in between are skipped.
+     The source file is `stupid.c'.
+
+   * Data flow analysis (`flow.c').  This pass divides the program into
+     basic blocks (and in the process deletes unreachable loops); then
+     it computes which pseudo-registers are live at each point in the
+     program, and makes the first instruction that uses a value point at
+     the instruction that computed the value.
+
+     This pass also deletes computations whose results are never used,
+     and combines memory references with add or subtract instructions
+     to make autoincrement or autodecrement addressing.
+
+     The option `-df' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.flow' to
+     the input file name.  If stupid register allocation is in use, this
+     dump file reflects the full results of such allocation.
+
+   * Instruction combination (`combine.c').  This pass attempts to
+     combine groups of two or three instructions that are related by
+     data flow into single instructions.  It combines the RTL
+     expressions for the instructions by substitution, simplifies the
+     result using algebra, and then attempts to match the result
+     against the machine description.
+
+     The option `-dc' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.combine'
+     to the input file name.
+
+   * Register movement (`regmove.c'). This pass looks for cases where
+     matching constraints would force an instruction to need a reload,
+     and this reload would be a register to register move.  It them
+     attempts to change the registers used by the instruction to avoid
+     the move instruction.
+
+     The option `-dN' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.regmove'
+     to the input file name.
+
+   * Instruction scheduling (`sched.c').  This pass looks for
+     instructions whose output will not be available by the time that
+     it is used in subsequent instructions.  (Memory loads and floating
+     point instructions often have this behavior on RISC machines).  It
+     re-orders instructions within a basic block to try to separate the
+     definition and use of items that otherwise would cause pipeline
+     stalls.
+
+     Instruction scheduling is performed twice.  The first time is
+     immediately after instruction combination and the second is
+     immediately after reload.
+
+     The option `-dS' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
+     pass is run for the first time.  The dump file's name is made by
+     appending `.sched' to the input file name.
+
+   * Register class preferencing.  The RTL code is scanned to find out
+     which register class is best for each pseudo register.  The source
+     file is `regclass.c'.
+
+   * Local register allocation (`local-alloc.c').  This pass allocates
+     hard registers to pseudo registers that are used only within one
+     basic block.  Because the basic block is linear, it can use fast
+     and powerful techniques to do a very good job.
+
+     The option `-dl' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.lreg' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Global register allocation (`global.c').  This pass allocates hard
+     registers for the remaining pseudo registers (those whose life
+     spans are not contained in one basic block).
+
+   * Reloading.  This pass renumbers pseudo registers with the hardware
+     registers numbers they were allocated.  Pseudo registers that did
+     not get hard registers are replaced with stack slots.  Then it
+     finds instructions that are invalid because a value has failed to
+     end up in a register, or has ended up in a register of the wrong
+     kind.  It fixes up these instructions by reloading the
+     problematical values temporarily into registers.  Additional
+     instructions are generated to do the copying.
+
+     The reload pass also optionally eliminates the frame pointer and
+     inserts instructions to save and restore call-clobbered registers
+     around calls.
+
+     Source files are `reload.c' and `reload1.c', plus the header
+     `reload.h' used for communication between them.
+
+     The option `-dg' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.greg' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Instruction scheduling is repeated here to try to avoid pipeline
+     stalls due to memory loads generated for spilled pseudo registers.
+
+     The option `-dR' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.sched2'
+     to the input file name.
+
+   * Jump optimization is repeated, this time including cross-jumping
+     and deletion of no-op move instructions.
+
+     The option `-dJ' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.jump2' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Delayed branch scheduling.  This optional pass attempts to find
+     instructions that can go into the delay slots of other
+     instructions, usually jumps and calls.  The source file name is
+     `reorg.c'.
+
+     The option `-dd' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.dbr' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Conversion from usage of some hard registers to usage of a register
+     stack may be done at this point.  Currently, this is supported only
+     for the floating-point registers of the Intel 80387 coprocessor.
+     The source file name is `reg-stack.c'.
+
+     The options `-dk' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
+     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.stack' to
+     the input file name.
+
+   * Final.  This pass outputs the assembler code for the function.  It
+     is also responsible for identifying spurious test and compare
+     instructions.  Machine-specific peephole optimizations are
+     performed at the same time.  The function entry and exit sequences
+     are generated directly as assembler code in this pass; they never
+     exist as RTL.
+
+     The source files are `final.c' plus `insn-output.c'; the latter is
+     generated automatically from the machine description by the tool
+     `genoutput'.  The header file `conditions.h' is used for
+     communication between these files.
+
+   * Debugging information output.  This is run after final because it
+     must output the stack slot offsets for pseudo registers that did
+     not get hard registers.  Source files are `dbxout.c' for DBX
+     symbol table format, `sdbout.c' for SDB symbol table format, and
+     `dwarfout.c' for DWARF symbol table format.
+
+   Some additional files are used by all or many passes:
+
+   * Every pass uses `machmode.def' and `machmode.h' which define the
+     machine modes.
+
+   * Several passes use `real.h', which defines the default
+     representation of floating point constants and how to operate on
+     them.
+
+   * All the passes that work with RTL use the header files `rtl.h' and
+     `rtl.def', and subroutines in file `rtl.c'.  The tools `gen*' also
+     use these files to read and work with the machine description RTL.
+
+   * Several passes refer to the header file `insn-config.h' which
+     contains a few parameters (C macro definitions) generated
+     automatically from the machine description RTL by the tool
+     `genconfig'.
+
+   * Several passes use the instruction recognizer, which consists of
+     `recog.c' and `recog.h', plus the files `insn-recog.c' and
+     `insn-extract.c' that are generated automatically from the machine
+     description by the tools `genrecog' and `genextract'.
+
+   * Several passes use the header files `regs.h' which defines the
+     information recorded about pseudo register usage, and
+     `basic-block.h' which defines the information recorded about basic
+     blocks.
+
+   * `hard-reg-set.h' defines the type `HARD_REG_SET', a bit-vector
+     with a bit for each hard register, and some macros to manipulate
+     it.  This type is just `int' if the machine has few enough hard
+     registers; otherwise it is an array of `int' and some of the
+     macros expand into loops.
+
+   * Several passes use instruction attributes.  A definition of the
+     attributes defined for a particular machine is in file
+     `insn-attr.h', which is generated from the machine description by
+     the program `genattr'.  The file `insn-attrtab.c' contains
+     subroutines to obtain the attribute values for insns.  It is
+     generated from the machine description by the program `genattrtab'.

+RTL Representation

+   RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.  It has both an internal form, made

+
+RTL Object Types
+================
+
+   RTL uses five kinds of objects: expressions, integers, wide integers,
+strings and vectors.  Expressions are the most important ones.  An RTL
+expression ("RTX", for short) is a C structure, but it is usually
+referred to with a pointer; a type that is given the typedef name `rtx'.
+
+   An integer is simply an `int'; their written form uses decimal
+digits.  A wide integer is an integral object whose type is
+`HOST_WIDE_INT' (*note Config::.); their written form uses decimal
+digits.
+
+   A string is a sequence of characters.  In core it is represented as a
+`char *' in usual C fashion, and it is written in C syntax as well.
+However, strings in RTL may never be null.  If you write an empty
+string in a machine description, it is represented in core as a null
+pointer rather than as a pointer to a null character.  In certain
+contexts, these null pointers instead of strings are valid.  Within RTL
+code, strings are most commonly found inside `symbol_ref' expressions,
+but they appear in other contexts in the RTL expressions that make up
+machine descriptions.
+
+   A vector contains an arbitrary number of pointers to expressions.
+The number of elements in the vector is explicitly present in the
+vector.  The written form of a vector consists of square brackets
+(`[...]') surrounding the elements, in sequence and with whitespace
+separating them.  Vectors of length zero are not created; null pointers
+are used instead.
+
+   Expressions are classified by "expression codes" (also called RTX
+codes).  The expression code is a name defined in `rtl.def', which is
+also (in upper case) a C enumeration constant.  The possible expression
+codes and their meanings are machine-independent.  The code of an RTX
+can be extracted with the macro `GET_CODE (X)' and altered with
+`PUT_CODE (X, NEWCODE)'.
+
+   The expression code determines how many operands the expression
+contains, and what kinds of objects they are.  In RTL, unlike Lisp, you
+cannot tell by looking at an operand what kind of object it is.
+Instead, you must know from its context--from the expression code of
+the containing expression.  For example, in an expression of code
+`subreg', the first operand is to be regarded as an expression and the
+second operand as an integer.  In an expression of code `plus', there
+are two operands, both of which are to be regarded as expressions.  In
+a `symbol_ref' expression, there is one operand, which is to be
+regarded as a string.
+
+   Expressions are written as parentheses containing the name of the
+expression type, its flags and machine mode if any, and then the
+operands of the expression (separated by spaces).
+
+   Expression code names in the `md' file are written in lower case,
+but when they appear in C code they are written in upper case.  In this
+manual, they are shown as follows: `const_int'.
+
+   In a few contexts a null pointer is valid where an expression is
+normally wanted.  The written form of this is `(nil)'.

+
+RTL Classes and Formats
+=======================
+
+   The various expression codes are divided into several "classes",
+which are represented by single characters.  You can determine the class
+of an RTX code with the macro `GET_RTX_CLASS (CODE)'.  Currently,
+`rtx.def' defines these classes:
+
+`o'
+     An RTX code that represents an actual object, such as a register
+     (`REG') or a memory location (`MEM', `SYMBOL_REF').  Constants and
+     basic transforms on objects (`ADDRESSOF', `HIGH', `LO_SUM') are
+     also included.  Note that `SUBREG' and `STRICT_LOW_PART' are not
+     in this class, but in class `x'.
+
+`<'
+     An RTX code for a comparison, such as `NE' or `LT'.
+
+`1'
+     An RTX code for a unary arithmetic operation, such as `NEG',
+     `NOT', or `ABS'.  This category also includes value extension
+     (sign or zero) and conversions between integer and floating point.
+
+`c'
+     An RTX code for a commutative binary operation, such as `PLUS' or
+     `AND'.  `NE' and `EQ' are comparisons, so they have class `<'.
+
+`2'
+     An RTX code for a non-commutative binary operation, such as
+     `MINUS', `DIV', or `ASHIFTRT'.
+
+`b'
+     An RTX code for a bitfield operation.  Currently only
+     `ZERO_EXTRACT' and `SIGN_EXTRACT'.  These have three inputs and
+     are lvalues (so they can be used for insertion as well).  *Note
+     Bit Fields::.
+
+`3'
+     An RTX code for other three input operations.  Currently only
+     `IF_THEN_ELSE'.
+
+`i'
+     An RTX code for an entire instruction:  `INSN', `JUMP_INSN', and
+     `CALL_INSN'. *Note Insns::.
+
+`m'
+     An RTX code for something that matches in insns, such as
+     `MATCH_DUP'.  These only occur in machine descriptions.
+
+`x'
+     All other RTX codes.  This category includes the remaining codes
+     used only in machine descriptions (`DEFINE_*', etc.).  It also
+     includes all the codes describing side effects (`SET', `USE',
+     `CLOBBER', etc.) and the non-insns that may appear on an insn
+     chain, such as `NOTE', `BARRIER', and `CODE_LABEL'.
+
+   For each expression type `rtl.def' specifies the number of contained
+objects and their kinds, with four possibilities: `e' for expression
+(actually a pointer to an expression), `i' for integer, `w' for wide
+integer, `s' for string, and `E' for vector of expressions.  The
+sequence of letters for an expression code is called its "format".  For
+example, the format of `subreg' is `ei'.
+
+   A few other format characters are used occasionally:
+
+`u'
+     `u' is equivalent to `e' except that it is printed differently in
+     debugging dumps.  It is used for pointers to insns.
+
+`n'
+     `n' is equivalent to `i' except that it is printed differently in
+     debugging dumps.  It is used for the line number or code number of
+     a `note' insn.
+
+`S'
+     `S' indicates a string which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
+     core, `S' is equivalent to `s', but when the object is read, from
+     an `md' file, the string value of this operand may be omitted.  An
+     omitted string is taken to be the null string.
+
+`V'
+     `V' indicates a vector which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
+     core, `V' is equivalent to `E', but when the object is read from
+     an `md' file, the vector value of this operand may be omitted.  An
+     omitted vector is effectively the same as a vector of no elements.
+
+`0'
+     `0' means a slot whose contents do not fit any normal category.
+     `0' slots are not printed at all in dumps, and are often used in
+     special ways by small parts of the compiler.
+
+   There are macros to get the number of operands and the format of an
+expression code:
+
+`GET_RTX_LENGTH (CODE)'
+     Number of operands of an RTX of code CODE.
+
+`GET_RTX_FORMAT (CODE)'
+     The format of an RTX of code CODE, as a C string.
+
+   Some classes of RTX codes always have the same format.  For example,
+it is safe to assume that all comparison operations have format `ee'.
+
+`1'
+     All codes of this class have format `e'.
+
+`<'
+`c'
+`2'
+     All codes of these classes have format `ee'.
+
+`b'
+`3'
+     All codes of these classes have format `eee'.
+
+`i'
+     All codes of this class have formats that begin with `iuueiee'.
+     *Note Insns::.  Note that not all RTL objects linked onto an insn
+     chain are of class `i'.
+
+`o'
+`m'
+`x'
+     You can make no assumptions about the format of these codes.

+
+Access to Operands
+==================
+
+   Operands of expressions are accessed using the macros `XEXP',
+`XINT', `XWINT' and `XSTR'.  Each of these macros takes two arguments:
+an expression-pointer (RTX) and an operand number (counting from zero).
+Thus,
+
+     XEXP (X, 2)
+
+accesses operand 2 of expression X, as an expression.
+
+     XINT (X, 2)
+
+accesses the same operand as an integer.  `XSTR', used in the same
+fashion, would access it as a string.
+
+   Any operand can be accessed as an integer, as an expression or as a
+string.  You must choose the correct method of access for the kind of
+value actually stored in the operand.  You would do this based on the
+expression code of the containing expression.  That is also how you
+would know how many operands there are.
+
+   For example, if X is a `subreg' expression, you know that it has two
+operands which can be correctly accessed as `XEXP (X, 0)' and `XINT (X,
+1)'.  If you did `XINT (X, 0)', you would get the address of the
+expression operand but cast as an integer; that might occasionally be
+useful, but it would be cleaner to write `(int) XEXP (X, 0)'.  `XEXP
+(X, 1)' would also compile without error, and would return the second,
+integer operand cast as an expression pointer, which would probably
+result in a crash when accessed.  Nothing stops you from writing `XEXP
+(X, 28)' either, but this will access memory past the end of the
+expression with unpredictable results.
+
+   Access to operands which are vectors is more complicated.  You can
+use the macro `XVEC' to get the vector-pointer itself, or the macros
+`XVECEXP' and `XVECLEN' to access the elements and length of a vector.
+
+`XVEC (EXP, IDX)'
+     Access the vector-pointer which is operand number IDX in EXP.
+
+`XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'
+     Access the length (number of elements) in the vector which is in
+     operand number IDX in EXP.  This value is an `int'.
+
+`XVECEXP (EXP, IDX, ELTNUM)'
+     Access element number ELTNUM in the vector which is in operand
+     number IDX in EXP.  This value is an RTX.
+
+     It is up to you to make sure that ELTNUM is not negative and is
+     less than `XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'.
+
+   All the macros defined in this section expand into lvalues and
+therefore can be used to assign the operands, lengths and vector
+elements as well as to access them.

+
+Flags in an RTL Expression
+==========================
+
+   RTL expressions contain several flags (one-bit bitfields) and other
+values that are used in certain types of expression.  Most often they
+are accessed with the following macros:
+
+`MEM_VOLATILE_P (X)'
+     In `mem' expressions, nonzero for volatile memory references.
+     Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.
+
+`MEM_IN_STRUCT_P (X)'
+     In `mem' expressions, nonzero for reference to an entire structure,
+     union or array, or to a component of one.  Zero for references to a
+     scalar variable or through a pointer to a scalar.  Stored in the
+     `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.  If both this flag and
+     MEM_SCALAR_P are clear, then we don't know whether this MEM is in a
+     structure or not.  Both flags should never be simultaneously set.
+
+`MEM_SCALAR_P (X)'
+     In `mem' expressions, nonzero for reference to a scalar known not
+     to be a member of a structure, union, or array.  Zero for such
+     references and for indirections through pointers, even pointers
+     pointing to scalar types.  If both this flag and MEM_STRUCT_P are
+     clear, then we don't know whether this MEM is in a structure or
+     not.  Both flags should never be simultaneously set.
+
+`MEM_ALIAS_SET (X)'
+     In `mem' expressions, the alias set to which X belongs.  If zero,
+     X is not in any alias set, and may alias anything.  If nonzero, X
+     may only alias objects in the same alias set.  This value is set
+     (in a language-specific manner) by the front-end.  This field is
+     not a bit-field; it is in an integer, found as the second argument
+     to the `mem'.
+
+`REG_LOOP_TEST_P'
+     In `reg' expressions, nonzero if this register's entire life is
+     contained in the exit test code for some loop.  Stored in the
+     `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.
+
+`REG_USERVAR_P (X)'
+     In a `reg', nonzero if it corresponds to a variable present in the
+     user's source code.  Zero for temporaries generated internally by
+     the compiler.  Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.
+
+`REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P (X)'
+     Nonzero in a `reg' if it is the place in which this function's
+     value is going to be returned.  (This happens only in a hard
+     register.)  Stored in the `integrated' field and printed as `/i'.
+
+     The same hard register may be used also for collecting the values
+     of functions called by this one, but `REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P' is zero
+     in this kind of use.
+
+`SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P'
+     Nonzero in a `subreg' if it was made when accessing an object that
+     was promoted to a wider mode in accord with the `PROMOTED_MODE'
+     machine description macro (*note Storage Layout::.).  In this
+     case, the mode of the `subreg' is the declared mode of the object
+     and the mode of `SUBREG_REG' is the mode of the register that
+     holds the object.  Promoted variables are always either sign- or
+     zero-extended to the wider mode on every assignment.  Stored in
+     the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.
+
+`SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_P'
+     Nonzero in a `subreg' that has `SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P' nonzero if
+     the object being referenced is kept zero-extended and zero if it
+     is kept sign-extended.  Stored in the `unchanging' field and
+     printed as `/u'.
+
+`RTX_UNCHANGING_P (X)'
+     Nonzero in a `reg' or `mem' if the value is not changed.  (This
+     flag is not set for memory references via pointers to constants.
+     Such pointers only guarantee that the object will not be changed
+     explicitly by the current function.  The object might be changed by
+     other functions or by aliasing.)  Stored in the `unchanging' field
+     and printed as `/u'.
+
+`RTX_INTEGRATED_P (INSN)'
+     Nonzero in an insn if it resulted from an in-line function call.
+     Stored in the `integrated' field and printed as `/i'.
+
+`RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P (X)'
+     Nonzero in an insn or expression which is part of a function
+     prologue and sets the stack pointer, sets the frame pointer, or
+     saves a register. This flag is required for exception handling
+     support on targets with RTL prologues.
+
+`SYMBOL_REF_USED (X)'
+     In a `symbol_ref', indicates that X has been used.  This is
+     normally only used to ensure that X is only declared external
+     once.  Stored in the `used' field.
+
+`SYMBOL_REF_FLAG (X)'
+     In a `symbol_ref', this is used as a flag for machine-specific
+     purposes.  Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.
+
+`LABEL_OUTSIDE_LOOP_P'
+     In `label_ref' expressions, nonzero if this is a reference to a
+     label that is outside the innermost loop containing the reference
+     to the label.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.
+
+`INSN_DELETED_P (INSN)'
+     In an insn, nonzero if the insn has been deleted.  Stored in the
+     `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.
+
+`INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P (INSN)'
+     In an `insn' in the delay slot of a branch insn, indicates that an
+     annulling branch should be used.  See the discussion under
+     `sequence' below.  Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as
+     `/u'.
+
+`INSN_FROM_TARGET_P (INSN)'
+     In an `insn' in a delay slot of a branch, indicates that the insn
+     is from the target of the branch.  If the branch insn has
+     `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' set, this insn will only be executed if
+     the branch is taken.  For annulled branches with
+     `INSN_FROM_TARGET_P' clear, the insn will be executed only if the
+     branch is not taken.  When `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' is not set,
+     this insn will always be executed.  Stored in the `in_struct'
+     field and printed as `/s'.
+
+`CONSTANT_POOL_ADDRESS_P (X)'
+     Nonzero in a `symbol_ref' if it refers to part of the current
+     function's "constants pool".  These are addresses close to the
+     beginning of the function, and GNU CC assumes they can be addressed
+     directly (perhaps with the help of base registers).  Stored in the
+     `unchanging' field and printed as `/u'.
+
+`CONST_CALL_P (X)'
+     In a `call_insn', indicates that the insn represents a call to a
+     const function.  Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as
+     `/u'.
+
+`LABEL_PRESERVE_P (X)'
+     In a `code_label', indicates that the label can never be deleted.
+     Labels referenced by a non-local goto will have this bit set.
+     Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.
+
+`SCHED_GROUP_P (INSN)'
+     During instruction scheduling, in an insn, indicates that the
+     previous insn must be scheduled together with this insn.  This is
+     used to ensure that certain groups of instructions will not be
+     split up by the instruction scheduling pass, for example, `use'
+     insns before a `call_insn' may not be separated from the
+     `call_insn'.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.
+
+   These are the fields which the above macros refer to:
+
+`used'
+     Normally, this flag is used only momentarily, at the end of RTL
+     generation for a function, to count the number of times an
+     expression appears in insns.  Expressions that appear more than
+     once are copied, according to the rules for shared structure
+     (*note Sharing::.).
+
+     In a `symbol_ref', it indicates that an external declaration for
+     the symbol has already been written.
+
+     In a `reg', it is used by the leaf register renumbering code to
+     ensure that each register is only renumbered once.
+
+`volatil'
+     This flag is used in `mem', `symbol_ref' and `reg' expressions and
+     in insns.  In RTL dump files, it is printed as `/v'.
+
+     In a `mem' expression, it is 1 if the memory reference is volatile.
+     Volatile memory references may not be deleted, reordered or
+     combined.
+
+     In a `symbol_ref' expression, it is used for machine-specific
+     purposes.
+
+     In a `reg' expression, it is 1 if the value is a user-level
+     variable.  0 indicates an internal compiler temporary.
+
+     In an insn, 1 means the insn has been deleted.
+
+`in_struct'
+     In `mem' expressions, it is 1 if the memory datum referred to is
+     all or part of a structure or array; 0 if it is (or might be) a
+     scalar variable.  A reference through a C pointer has 0 because
+     the pointer might point to a scalar variable.  This information
+     allows the compiler to determine something about possible cases of
+     aliasing.
+
+     In an insn in the delay slot of a branch, 1 means that this insn
+     is from the target of the branch.
+
+     During instruction scheduling, in an insn, 1 means that this insn
+     must be scheduled as part of a group together with the previous
+     insn.
+
+     In `reg' expressions, it is 1 if the register has its entire life
+     contained within the test expression of some loop.
+
+     In `subreg' expressions, 1 means that the `subreg' is accessing an
+     object that has had its mode promoted from a wider mode.
+
+     In `label_ref' expressions, 1 means that the referenced label is
+     outside the innermost loop containing the insn in which the
+     `label_ref' was found.
+
+     In `code_label' expressions, it is 1 if the label may never be
+     deleted.  This is used for labels which are the target of
+     non-local gotos.
+
+     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/s'.
+
+`unchanging'
+     In `reg' and `mem' expressions, 1 means that the value of the
+     expression never changes.
+
+     In `subreg' expressions, it is 1 if the `subreg' references an
+     unsigned object whose mode has been promoted to a wider mode.
+
+     In an insn, 1 means that this is an annulling branch.
+
+     In a `symbol_ref' expression, 1 means that this symbol addresses
+     something in the per-function constants pool.
+
+     In a `call_insn', 1 means that this instruction is a call to a
+     const function.
+
+     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/u'.
+
+`integrated'
+     In some kinds of expressions, including insns, this flag means the
+     rtl was produced by procedure integration.
+
+     In a `reg' expression, this flag indicates the register containing
+     the value to be returned by the current function.  On machines
+     that pass parameters in registers, the same register number may be
+     used for parameters as well, but this flag is not set on such uses.

+
+Machine Modes
+=============
+
+   A machine mode describes a size of data object and the
+representation used for it.  In the C code, machine modes are
+represented by an enumeration type, `enum machine_mode', defined in
+`machmode.def'.  Each RTL expression has room for a machine mode and so
+do certain kinds of tree expressions (declarations and types, to be
+precise).
+
+   In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an
+RTL expression is written after the expression code with a colon to
+separate them.  The letters `mode' which appear at the end of each
+machine mode name are omitted.  For example, `(reg:SI 38)' is a `reg'
+expression with machine mode `SImode'.  If the mode is `VOIDmode', it
+is not written at all.
+
+   Here is a table of machine modes.  The term "byte" below refers to an
+object of `BITS_PER_UNIT' bits (*note Storage Layout::.).
+
+`QImode'
+     "Quarter-Integer" mode represents a single byte treated as an
+     integer.
+
+`HImode'
+     "Half-Integer" mode represents a two-byte integer.
+
+`PSImode'
+     "Partial Single Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
+     four bytes but which doesn't really use all four.  On some
+     machines, this is the right mode to use for pointers.
+
+`SImode'
+     "Single Integer" mode represents a four-byte integer.
+
+`PDImode'
+     "Partial Double Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
+     eight bytes but which doesn't really use all eight.  On some
+     machines, this is the right mode to use for certain pointers.
+
+`DImode'
+     "Double Integer" mode represents an eight-byte integer.
+
+`TImode'
+     "Tetra Integer" (?) mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.
+
+`SFmode'
+     "Single Floating" mode represents a single-precision (four byte)
+     floating point number.
+
+`DFmode'
+     "Double Floating" mode represents a double-precision (eight byte)
+     floating point number.
+
+`XFmode'
+     "Extended Floating" mode represents a triple-precision (twelve
+     byte) floating point number.  This mode is used for IEEE extended
+     floating point.  On some systems not all bits within these bytes
+     will actually be used.
+
+`TFmode'
+     "Tetra Floating" mode represents a quadruple-precision (sixteen
+     byte) floating point number.
+
+`CCmode'
+     "Condition Code" mode represents the value of a condition code,
+     which is a machine-specific set of bits used to represent the
+     result of a comparison operation.  Other machine-specific modes
+     may also be used for the condition code.  These modes are not used
+     on machines that use `cc0' (see *note Condition Code::.).
+
+`BLKmode'
+     "Block" mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
+     the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have
+     this mode, and only if they appear in string-move or vector
+     instructions.  On machines which have no such instructions,
+     `BLKmode' will not appear in RTL.
+
+`VOIDmode'
+     Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode.  For
+     example, RTL expressions of code `const_int' have mode `VOIDmode'
+     because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context
+     requires.  In debugging dumps of RTL, `VOIDmode' is expressed by
+     the absence of any mode.
+
+`SCmode, DCmode, XCmode, TCmode'
+     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
+     floating point values.  The floating point values are in `SFmode',
+     `DFmode', `XFmode', and `TFmode', respectively.
+
+`CQImode, CHImode, CSImode, CDImode, CTImode, COImode'
+     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
+     integer values.  The integer values are in `QImode', `HImode',
+     `SImode', `DImode', `TImode', and `OImode', respectively.
+
+   The machine description defines `Pmode' as a C macro which expands
+into the machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is the mode
+whose size is `BITS_PER_WORD', `SImode' on 32-bit machines.
+
+   The only modes which a machine description must support are
+`QImode', and the modes corresponding to `BITS_PER_WORD',
+`FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE' and `DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  The compiler will attempt to
+use `DImode' for 8-byte structures and unions, but this can be
+prevented by overriding the definition of `MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'.
+Alternatively, you can have the compiler use `TImode' for 16-byte
+structures and unions.  Likewise, you can arrange for the C type `short
+int' to avoid using `HImode'.
+
+   Very few explicit references to machine modes remain in the compiler
+and these few references will soon be removed.  Instead, the machine
+modes are divided into mode classes.  These are represented by the
+enumeration type `enum mode_class' defined in `machmode.h'.  The
+possible mode classes are:
+
+`MODE_INT'
+     Integer modes.  By default these are `QImode', `HImode', `SImode',
+     `DImode', and `TImode'.
+
+`MODE_PARTIAL_INT'
+     The "partial integer" modes, `PSImode' and `PDImode'.
+
+`MODE_FLOAT'
+     floating point modes.  By default these are `SFmode', `DFmode',
+     `XFmode' and `TFmode'.
+
+`MODE_COMPLEX_INT'
+     Complex integer modes.  (These are not currently implemented).
+
+`MODE_COMPLEX_FLOAT'
+     Complex floating point modes.  By default these are `SCmode',
+     `DCmode', `XCmode', and `TCmode'.
+
+`MODE_FUNCTION'
+     Algol or Pascal function variables including a static chain.
+     (These are not currently implemented).
+
+`MODE_CC'
+     Modes representing condition code values.  These are `CCmode' plus
+     any modes listed in the `EXTRA_CC_MODES' macro.  *Note Jump
+     Patterns::, also see *Note Condition Code::.
+
+`MODE_RANDOM'
+     This is a catchall mode class for modes which don't fit into the
+     above classes.  Currently `VOIDmode' and `BLKmode' are in
+     `MODE_RANDOM'.
+
+   Here are some C macros that relate to machine modes:
+
+`GET_MODE (X)'
+     Returns the machine mode of the RTX X.
+
+`PUT_MODE (X, NEWMODE)'
+     Alters the machine mode of the RTX X to be NEWMODE.
+
+`NUM_MACHINE_MODES'
+     Stands for the number of machine modes available on the target
+     machine.  This is one greater than the largest numeric value of any
+     machine mode.
+
+`GET_MODE_NAME (M)'
+     Returns the name of mode M as a string.
+
+`GET_MODE_CLASS (M)'
+     Returns the mode class of mode M.
+
+`GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (M)'
+     Returns the next wider natural mode.  For example, the expression
+     `GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (QImode)' returns `HImode'.
+
+`GET_MODE_SIZE (M)'
+     Returns the size in bytes of a datum of mode M.
+
+`GET_MODE_BITSIZE (M)'
+     Returns the size in bits of a datum of mode M.
+
+`GET_MODE_MASK (M)'
+     Returns a bitmask containing 1 for all bits in a word that fit
+     within mode M.  This macro can only be used for modes whose
+     bitsize is less than or equal to `HOST_BITS_PER_INT'.
+
+`GET_MODE_ALIGNMENT (M))'
+     Return the required alignment, in bits, for an object of mode M.
+
+`GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE (M)'
+     Returns the size in bytes of the subunits of a datum of mode M.
+     This is the same as `GET_MODE_SIZE' except in the case of complex
+     modes.  For them, the unit size is the size of the real or
+     imaginary part.
+
+`GET_MODE_NUNITS (M)'
+     Returns the number of units contained in a mode, i.e.,
+     `GET_MODE_SIZE' divided by `GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE'.
+
+`GET_CLASS_NARROWEST_MODE (C)'
+     Returns the narrowest mode in mode class C.
+
+   The global variables `byte_mode' and `word_mode' contain modes whose
+classes are `MODE_INT' and whose bitsizes are either `BITS_PER_UNIT' or
+`BITS_PER_WORD', respectively.  On 32-bit machines, these are `QImode'
+and `SImode', respectively.

+
+Constant Expression Types
+=========================
+
+   The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant
+values.
+
+`(const_int I)'
+     This type of expression represents the integer value I.  I is
+     customarily accessed with the macro `INTVAL' as in `INTVAL (EXP)',
+     which is equivalent to `XWINT (EXP, 0)'.
+
+     There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it
+     is the value of the variable `const0_rtx'.  Likewise, the only
+     expression for integer value one is found in `const1_rtx', the only
+     expression for integer value two is found in `const2_rtx', and the
+     only expression for integer value negative one is found in
+     `constm1_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
+     `const_int' and value zero, one, two or negative one will return
+     `const0_rtx', `const1_rtx', `const2_rtx' or `constm1_rtx' as
+     appropriate.
+
+     Similarly, there is only one object for the integer whose value is
+     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is found in `const_true_rtx'.  If
+     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is one, `const_true_rtx' and `const1_rtx' will
+     point to the same object.  If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is -1,
+     `const_true_rtx' and `constm1_rtx' will point to the same object.
+
+`(const_double:M ADDR I0 I1 ...)'
+     Represents either a floating-point constant of mode M or an
+     integer constant too large to fit into `HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT'
+     bits but small enough to fit within twice that number of bits (GNU
+     CC does not provide a mechanism to represent even larger
+     constants).  In the latter case, M will be `VOIDmode'.
+
+     ADDR is used to contain the `mem' expression that corresponds to
+     the location in memory that at which the constant can be found.  If
+     it has not been allocated a memory location, but is on the chain
+     of all `const_double' expressions in this compilation (maintained
+     using an undisplayed field), ADDR contains `const0_rtx'.  If it is
+     not on the chain, ADDR contains `cc0_rtx'.  ADDR is customarily
+     accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_MEM' and the chain field via
+     `CONST_DOUBLE_CHAIN'.
+
+     If M is `VOIDmode', the bits of the value are stored in I0 and I1.
+     I0 is customarily accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_LOW' and
+     I1 with `CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH'.
+
+     If the constant is floating point (regardless of its precision),
+     then the number of integers used to store the value depends on the
+     size of `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' (*note Cross-compilation::.).  The
+     integers represent a floating point number, but not precisely in
+     the target machine's or host machine's floating point format.  To
+     convert them to the precise bit pattern used by the target
+     machine, use the macro `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' and friends
+     (*note Data Output::.).
+
+     The macro `CONST0_RTX (MODE)' refers to an expression with value 0
+     in mode MODE.  If mode MODE is of mode class `MODE_INT', it
+     returns `const0_rtx'.  Otherwise, it returns a `CONST_DOUBLE'
+     expression in mode MODE.  Similarly, the macro `CONST1_RTX (MODE)'
+     refers to an expression with value 1 in mode MODE and similarly
+     for `CONST2_RTX'.
+
+`(const_string STR)'
+     Represents a constant string with value STR.  Currently this is
+     used only for insn attributes (*note Insn Attributes::.) since
+     constant strings in C are placed in memory.
+
+`(symbol_ref:MODE SYMBOL)'
+     Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  SYMBOL is a
+     string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it
+     starts with a `*', the label is the rest of SYMBOL not including
+     the `*'.  Otherwise, the label is SYMBOL, usually prefixed with
+     `_'.
+
+     The `symbol_ref' contains a mode, which is usually `Pmode'.
+     Usually that is the only mode for which a symbol is directly valid.
+
+`(label_ref LABEL)'
+     Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains
+     one operand, an expression, which must be a `code_label' that
+     appears in the instruction sequence to identify the place where
+     the label should go.
+
+     The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
+     references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.
+
+`(const:M EXP)'
+     Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
+     arithmetic computation.  The operand, EXP, is an expression that
+     contains only constants (`const_int', `symbol_ref' and `label_ref'
+     expressions) combined with `plus' and `minus'.  However, not all
+     combinations are valid, since the assembler cannot do arbitrary
+     arithmetic on relocatable symbols.
+
+     M should be `Pmode'.
+
+`(high:M EXP)'
+     Represents the high-order bits of EXP, usually a `symbol_ref'.
+     The number of bits is machine-dependent and is normally the number
+     of bits specified in an instruction that initializes the high
+     order bits of a register.  It is used with `lo_sum' to represent
+     the typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to
+     reference a global memory location.
+
+     M should be `Pmode'.

+
+Registers and Memory
+====================
+
+   Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
+registers and to main memory.
+
+`(reg:M N)'
+     For small values of the integer N (those that are less than
+     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'), this stands for a reference to machine
+     register number N: a "hard register".  For larger values of N, it
+     stands for a temporary value or "pseudo register".  The compiler's
+     strategy is to generate code assuming an unlimited number of such
+     pseudo registers, and later convert them into hard registers or
+     into memory references.
+
+     M is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
+     machines can generally refer to each register in more than one
+     mode.  For example, a register may contain a full word but there
+     may be instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single
+     byte, as well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point
+     number of various precisions.
+
+     Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode,
+     the mode must always be specified.
+
+     The symbol `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER' is defined by the machine
+     description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is
+     an invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that
+     not all of the machine registers must be general registers.  All
+     the machine registers that can be used for storage of data are
+     given hard register numbers, even those that can be used only in
+     certain instructions or can hold only certain types of data.
+
+     A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
+     function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode and is
+     accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe an
+     access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a `subreg'
+     expression is used.
+
+     A `reg' expression with a machine mode that specifies more than
+     one word of data may actually stand for several consecutive
+     registers.  If in addition the register number specifies a
+     hardware register, then it actually represents several consecutive
+     hardware registers starting with the specified one.
+
+     Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
+     represented by a unique `reg' expression.
+
+     Some pseudo register numbers, those within the range of
+     `FIRST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' to `LAST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' only appear
+     during the RTL generation phase and are eliminated before the
+     optimization phases.  These represent locations in the stack frame
+     that cannot be determined until RTL generation for the function
+     has been completed.  The following virtual register numbers are
+     defined:
+
+    `VIRTUAL_INCOMING_ARGS_REGNUM'
+          This points to the first word of the incoming arguments
+          passed on the stack.  Normally these arguments are placed
+          there by the caller, but the callee may have pushed some
+          arguments that were previously passed in registers.
+
+          When RTL generation is complete, this virtual register is
+          replaced by the sum of the register given by
+          `ARG_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value of `FIRST_PARM_OFFSET'.
+
+    `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM'
+          If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined, this points to
+          immediately above the first variable on the stack.
+          Otherwise, it points to the first variable on the stack.
+
+          `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM' is replaced with the sum of the
+          register given by `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
+          `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.
+
+    `VIRTUAL_STACK_DYNAMIC_REGNUM'
+          This points to the location of dynamically allocated memory
+          on the stack immediately after the stack pointer has been
+          adjusted by the amount of memory desired.
+
+          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
+          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
+          `STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET'.
+
+    `VIRTUAL_OUTGOING_ARGS_REGNUM'
+          This points to the location in the stack at which outgoing
+          arguments should be written when the stack is pre-pushed
+          (arguments pushed using push insns should always use
+          `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM').
+
+          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
+          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
+          `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'.
+
+`(subreg:M REG WORDNUM)'
+     `subreg' expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine
+     mode other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of a
+     multi-word `reg' that actually refers to several registers.
+
+     Each pseudo-register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
+     operate on it in a different mode--for example, to perform a
+     fullword move instruction on a pseudo-register that contains a
+     single byte--the pseudo-register must be enclosed in a `subreg'.
+     In such a case, WORDNUM is zero.
+
+     Usually M is at least as narrow as the mode of REG, in which case
+     it is restricting consideration to only the bits of REG that are
+     in M.
+
+     Sometimes M is wider than the mode of REG.  These `subreg'
+     expressions are often called "paradoxical".  They are used in
+     cases where we want to refer to an object in a wider mode but do
+     not care what value the additional bits have.  The reload pass
+     ensures that paradoxical references are only made to hard
+     registers.
+
+     The other use of `subreg' is to extract the individual registers of
+     a multi-register value.  Machine modes such as `DImode' and
+     `TImode' can indicate values longer than a word, values which
+     usually require two or more consecutive registers.  To access one
+     of the registers, use a `subreg' with mode `SImode' and a WORDNUM
+     that says which register.
+
+     Storing in a non-paradoxical `subreg' has undefined results for
+     bits belonging to the same word as the `subreg'.  This laxity makes
+     it easier to generate efficient code for such instructions.  To
+     represent an instruction that preserves all the bits outside of
+     those in the `subreg', use `strict_low_part' around the `subreg'.
+
+     The compilation parameter `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN', if set to 1, says
+     that word number zero is the most significant part; otherwise, it
+     is the least significant part.
+
+     On a few targets, `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' disagrees with
+     `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.  However, most parts of the compiler treat
+     floating point values as if they had the same endianness as
+     integer values.  This works because they handle them solely as a
+     collection of integer values, with no particular numerical value.
+     Only real.c and the runtime libraries care about
+     `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.
+
+     Between the combiner pass and the reload pass, it is possible to
+     have a paradoxical `subreg' which contains a `mem' instead of a
+     `reg' as its first operand.  After the reload pass, it is also
+     possible to have a non-paradoxical `subreg' which contains a
+     `mem'; this usually occurs when the `mem' is a stack slot which
+     replaced a pseudo register.
+
+     Note that it is not valid to access a `DFmode' value in `SFmode'
+     using a `subreg'.  On some machines the most significant part of a
+     `DFmode' value does not have the same format as a single-precision
+     floating value.
+
+     It is also not valid to access a single word of a multi-word value
+     in a hard register when less registers can hold the value than
+     would be expected from its size.  For example, some 32-bit
+     machines have floating-point registers that can hold an entire
+     `DFmode' value.  If register 10 were such a register `(subreg:SI
+     (reg:DF 10) 1)' would be invalid because there is no way to
+     convert that reference to a single machine register.  The reload
+     pass prevents `subreg' expressions such as these from being formed.
+
+     The first operand of a `subreg' expression is customarily accessed
+     with the `SUBREG_REG' macro and the second operand is customarily
+     accessed with the `SUBREG_WORD' macro.
+
+`(scratch:M)'
+     This represents a scratch register that will be required for the
+     execution of a single instruction and not used subsequently.  It is
+     converted into a `reg' by either the local register allocator or
+     the reload pass.
+
+     `scratch' is usually present inside a `clobber' operation (*note
+     Side Effects::.).
+
+`(cc0)'
+     This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
+     operands and may not have a machine mode.  There are two ways to
+     use it:
+
+        * To stand for a complete set of condition code flags.  This is
+          best on most machines, where each comparison sets the entire
+          series of flags.
+
+          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
+          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
+          compare instructions) and in comparison operators comparing
+          against zero (`const_int' with value zero; that is to say,
+          `const0_rtx').
+
+        * To stand for a single flag that is the result of a single
+          condition.  This is useful on machines that have only a
+          single flag bit, and in which comparison instructions must
+          specify the condition to test.
+
+          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
+          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
+          compare instructions) where the source is a comparison
+          operator, and as the first operand of `if_then_else' (in a
+          conditional branch).
+
+     There is only one expression object of code `cc0'; it is the value
+     of the variable `cc0_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
+     code `cc0' will return `cc0_rtx'.
+
+     Instructions can set the condition code implicitly.  On many
+     machines, nearly all instructions set the condition code based on
+     the value that they compute or store.  It is not necessary to
+     record these actions explicitly in the RTL because the machine
+     description includes a prescription for recognizing the
+     instructions that do so (by means of the macro
+     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC').  *Note Condition Code::.  Only instructions
+     whose sole purpose is to set the condition code, and instructions
+     that use the condition code, need mention `(cc0)'.
+
+     On some machines, the condition code register is given a register
+     number and a `reg' is used instead of `(cc0)'.  This is usually the
+     preferable approach if only a small subset of instructions modify
+     the condition code.  Other machines store condition codes in
+     general registers; in such cases a pseudo register should be used.
+
+     Some machines, such as the Sparc and RS/6000, have two sets of
+     arithmetic instructions, one that sets and one that does not set
+     the condition code.  This is best handled by normally generating
+     the instruction that does not set the condition code, and making a
+     pattern that both performs the arithmetic and sets the condition
+     code register (which would not be `(cc0)' in this case).  For
+     examples, search for `addcc' and `andcc' in `sparc.md'.
+
+`(pc)'
+     This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands
+     and may not have a machine mode.  `(pc)' may be validly used only
+     in certain specific contexts in jump instructions.
+
+     There is only one expression object of code `pc'; it is the value
+     of the variable `pc_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
+     code `pc' will return `pc_rtx'.
+
+     All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter
+     implicitly by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention
+     this in the RTL.
+
+`(mem:M ADDR)'
+     This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
+     represented by the expression ADDR.  M specifies how large a unit
+     of memory is accessed.
+
+`(addressof:M REG)'
+     This RTX represents a request for the address of register REG.
+     Its mode is always `Pmode'.  If there are any `addressof'
+     expressions left in the function after CSE, REG is forced into the
+     stack and the `addressof' expression is replaced with a `plus'
+     expression for the address of its stack slot.

+
+RTL Expressions for Arithmetic
+==============================
+
+   Unless otherwise specified, all the operands of arithmetic
+expressions must be valid for mode M.  An operand is valid for mode M
+if it has mode M, or if it is a `const_int' or `const_double' and M is
+a mode of class `MODE_INT'.
+
+   For commutative binary operations, constants should be placed in the
+second operand.
+
+`(plus:M X Y)'
+     Represents the sum of the values represented by X and Y carried
+     out in machine mode M.
+
+`(lo_sum:M X Y)'
+     Like `plus', except that it represents that sum of X and the
+     low-order bits of Y.  The number of low order bits is
+     machine-dependent but is normally the number of bits in a `Pmode'
+     item minus the number of bits set by the `high' code (*note
+     Constants::.).
+
+     M should be `Pmode'.
+
+`(minus:M X Y)'
+     Like `plus' but represents subtraction.
+
+`(compare:M X Y)'
+     Represents the result of subtracting Y from X for purposes of
+     comparison.  The result is computed without overflow, as if with
+     infinite precision.
+
+     Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision.
+     However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the
+     result will be used, which is the case when the result is stored
+     in the condition code.   And that is the only way this kind of
+     expression may validly be used: as a value to be stored in the
+     condition codes.
+
+     The mode M is not related to the modes of X and Y, but instead is
+     the mode of the condition code value.  If `(cc0)' is used, it is
+     `VOIDmode'.  Otherwise it is some mode in class `MODE_CC', often
+     `CCmode'.  *Note Condition Code::.
+
+     Normally, X and Y must have the same mode.  Otherwise, `compare'
+     is valid only if the mode of X is in class `MODE_INT' and Y is a
+     `const_int' or `const_double' with mode `VOIDmode'.  The mode of X
+     determines what mode the comparison is to be done in; thus it must
+     not be `VOIDmode'.
+
+     If one of the operands is a constant, it should be placed in the
+     second operand and the comparison code adjusted as appropriate.
+
+     A `compare' specifying two `VOIDmode' constants is not valid since
+     there is no way to know in what mode the comparison is to be
+     performed; the comparison must either be folded during the
+     compilation or the first operand must be loaded into a register
+     while its mode is still known.
+
+`(neg:M X)'
+     Represents the negation (subtraction from zero) of the value
+     represented by X, carried out in mode M.
+
+`(mult:M X Y)'
+     Represents the signed product of the values represented by X and Y
+     carried out in machine mode M.
+
+     Some machines support a multiplication that generates a product
+     wider than the operands.  Write the pattern for this as
+
+          (mult:M (sign_extend:M X) (sign_extend:M Y))
+
+     where M is wider than the modes of X and Y, which need not be the
+     same.
+
+     Write patterns for unsigned widening multiplication similarly using
+     `zero_extend'.
+
+`(div:M X Y)'
+     Represents the quotient in signed division of X by Y, carried out
+     in machine mode M.  If M is a floating point mode, it represents
+     the exact quotient; otherwise, the integerized quotient.
+
+     Some machines have division instructions in which the operands and
+     quotient widths are not all the same; you should represent such
+     instructions using `truncate' and `sign_extend' as in,
+
+          (truncate:M1 (div:M2 X (sign_extend:M2 Y)))
+
+`(udiv:M X Y)'
+     Like `div' but represents unsigned division.
+
+`(mod:M X Y)'
+`(umod:M X Y)'
+     Like `div' and `udiv' but represent the remainder instead of the
+     quotient.
+
+`(smin:M X Y)'
+`(smax:M X Y)'
+     Represents the smaller (for `smin') or larger (for `smax') of X
+     and Y, interpreted as signed integers in mode M.
+
+`(umin:M X Y)'
+`(umax:M X Y)'
+     Like `smin' and `smax', but the values are interpreted as unsigned
+     integers.
+
+`(not:M X)'
+     Represents the bitwise complement of the value represented by X,
+     carried out in mode M, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.
+
+`(and:M X Y)'
+     Represents the bitwise logical-and of the values represented by X
+     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
+     machine mode.
+
+`(ior:M X Y)'
+     Represents the bitwise inclusive-or of the values represented by X
+     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
+     mode.
+
+`(xor:M X Y)'
+     Represents the bitwise exclusive-or of the values represented by X
+     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
+     mode.
+
+`(ashift:M X C)'
+     Represents the result of arithmetically shifting X left by C
+     places.  X have mode M, a fixed-point machine mode.  C be a
+     fixed-point mode or be a constant with mode `VOIDmode'; which mode
+     is determined by the mode called for in the machine description
+     entry for the left-shift instruction.  For example, on the Vax,
+     the mode of C is `QImode' regardless of M.
+
+`(lshiftrt:M X C)'
+`(ashiftrt:M X C)'
+     Like `ashift' but for right shift.  Unlike the case for left shift,
+     these two operations are distinct.
+
+`(rotate:M X C)'
+`(rotatert:M X C)'
+     Similar but represent left and right rotate.  If C is a constant,
+     use `rotate'.
+
+`(abs:M X)'
+     Represents the absolute value of X, computed in mode M.
+
+`(sqrt:M X)'
+     Represents the square root of X, computed in mode M.  Most often M
+     will be a floating point mode.
+
+`(ffs:M X)'
+     Represents one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit in X,
+     represented as an integer of mode M.  (The value is zero if X is
+     zero.)  The mode of X need not be M; depending on the target
+     machine, various mode combinations may be valid.

+
+Comparison Operations
+=====================
+
+   Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are
+considered to represent a machine-dependent nonzero value described by,
+but not necessarily equal to, `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::.)  if
+the relation holds, or zero if it does not.  The mode of the comparison
+operation is independent of the mode of the data being compared.  If
+the comparison operation is being tested (e.g., the first operand of an
+`if_then_else'), the mode must be `VOIDmode'.  If the comparison
+operation is producing data to be stored in some variable, the mode
+must be in class `MODE_INT'.  All comparison operations producing data
+must use the same mode, which is machine-specific.
+
+   There are two ways that comparison operations may be used.  The
+comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes `(cc0)'
+against zero, as in `(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))'.  Such a construct
+actually refers to the result of the preceding instruction in which the
+condition codes were set.  The instructing setting the condition code
+must be adjacent to the instruction using the condition code; only
+`note' insns may separate them.
+
+   Alternatively, a comparison operation may directly compare two data
+objects.  The mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they
+must both be valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both
+operands constant would be invalid as the machine mode could not be
+deduced from it, but such a comparison should never exist in RTL due to
+constant folding.
+
+   In the example above, if `(cc0)' were last set to `(compare X Y)',
+the comparison operation is identical to `(eq X Y)'.  Usually only one
+style of comparisons is supported on a particular machine, but the
+combine pass will try to merge the operations to produce the `eq' shown
+in case it exists in the context of the particular insn involved.
+
+   Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.
+Thus, there are distinct expression codes `gt' and `gtu' for signed and
+unsigned greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same
+pair of integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not
+unsigned greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually
+`0xffffffff' which is greater than 1.
+
+   The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.
+Floating point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of
+the operands.
+
+`(eq:M X Y)'
+     1 if the values represented by X and Y are equal, otherwise 0.
+
+`(ne:M X Y)'
+     1 if the values represented by X and Y are not equal, otherwise 0.
+
+`(gt:M X Y)'
+     1 if the X is greater than Y.  If they are fixed-point, the
+     comparison is done in a signed sense.
+
+`(gtu:M X Y)'
+     Like `gt' but does unsigned comparison, on fixed-point numbers
+     only.
+
+`(lt:M X Y)'
+`(ltu:M X Y)'
+     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than".
+
+`(ge:M X Y)'
+`(geu:M X Y)'
+     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "greater than or equal".
+
+`(le:M X Y)'
+`(leu:M X Y)'
+     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than or equal".
+
+`(if_then_else COND THEN ELSE)'
+     This is not a comparison operation but is listed here because it is
+     always used in conjunction with a comparison operation.  To be
+     precise, COND is a comparison expression.  This expression
+     represents a choice, according to COND, between the value
+     represented by THEN and the one represented by ELSE.
+
+     On most machines, `if_then_else' expressions are valid only to
+     express conditional jumps.
+
+`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 TEST2 VALUE2 ...] DEFAULT)'
+     Similar to `if_then_else', but more general.  Each of TEST1,
+     TEST2, ... is performed in turn.  The result of this expression is
+     the VALUE corresponding to the first non-zero test, or DEFAULT if
+     none of the tests are non-zero expressions.
+
+     This is currently not valid for instruction patterns and is
+     supported only for insn attributes.  *Note Insn Attributes::.

+
+Bit Fields
+==========
+
+   Special expression codes exist to represent bitfield instructions.
+These types of expressions are lvalues in RTL; they may appear on the
+left side of an assignment, indicating insertion of a value into the
+specified bit field.
+
+`(sign_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
+     This represents a reference to a sign-extended bit field contained
+     or starting in LOC (a memory or register reference).  The bit field
+     is SIZE bits wide and starts at bit POS.  The compilation option
+     `BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' says which end of the memory unit POS counts
+     from.
+
+     If LOC is in memory, its mode must be a single-byte integer mode.
+     If LOC is in a register, the mode to use is specified by the
+     operand of the `insv' or `extv' pattern (*note Standard Names::.)
+     and is usually a full-word integer mode, which is the default if
+     none is specified.
+
+     The mode of POS is machine-specific and is also specified in the
+     `insv' or `extv' pattern.
+
+     The mode M is the same as the mode that would be used for LOC if
+     it were a register.
+
+`(zero_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
+     Like `sign_extract' but refers to an unsigned or zero-extended bit
+     field.  The same sequence of bits are extracted, but they are
+     filled to an entire word with zeros instead of by sign-extension.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Conversions,  Next: RTL Declarations,  Prev: Bit Fields,  Up: RTL
+
+Conversions
+===========
+
+   All conversions between machine modes must be represented by
+explicit conversion operations.  For example, an expression which is
+the sum of a byte and a full word cannot be written as `(plus:SI
+(reg:QI 34) (reg:SI 80))' because the `plus' operation requires two
+operands of the same machine mode.  Therefore, the byte-sized operand
+is enclosed in a conversion operation, as in
+
+     (plus:SI (sign_extend:SI (reg:QI 34)) (reg:SI 80))
+
+   The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there
+may be more than one way of converting from a given starting mode to
+the desired final mode.  The conversion operation code says how to do
+it.
+
+   For all conversion operations, X must not be `VOIDmode' because the
+mode in which to do the conversion would not be known.  The conversion
+must either be done at compile-time or X must be placed into a register.
+
+`(sign_extend:M X)'
+     Represents the result of sign-extending the value X to machine
+     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
+     a mode narrower than M.
+
+`(zero_extend:M X)'
+     Represents the result of zero-extending the value X to machine
+     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
+     a mode narrower than M.
+
+`(float_extend:M X)'
+     Represents the result of extending the value X to machine mode M.
+     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
+     mode narrower than M.
+
+`(truncate:M X)'
+     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
+     M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode
+     wider than M.
+
+`(float_truncate:M X)'
+     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
+     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
+     mode wider than M.
+
+`(float:M X)'
+     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
+     as signed, to floating point mode M.
+
+`(unsigned_float:M X)'
+     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
+     as unsigned, to floating point mode M.
+
+`(fix:M X)'
+     When M is a fixed point mode, represents the result of converting
+     floating point value X to mode M, regarded as signed.  How
+     rounding is done is not specified, so this operation may be used
+     validly in compiling C code only for integer-valued operands.
+
+`(unsigned_fix:M X)'
+     Represents the result of converting floating point value X to
+     fixed point mode M, regarded as unsigned.  How rounding is done is
+     not specified.
+
+`(fix:M X)'
+     When M is a floating point mode, represents the result of
+     converting floating point value X (valid for mode M) to an
+     integer, still represented in floating point mode M, by rounding
+     towards zero.

+Declarations
+============
+
+   Declaration expression codes do not represent arithmetic operations
+but rather state assertions about their operands.
+
+`(strict_low_part (subreg:M (reg:N R) 0))'
+     This expression code is used in only one context: as the
+     destination operand of a `set' expression.  In addition, the
+     operand of this expression must be a non-paradoxical `subreg'
+     expression.
+
+     The presence of `strict_low_part' says that the part of the
+     register which is meaningful in mode N, but is not part of mode M,

+
+Side Effect Expressions
+=======================
+
+   The expression codes described so far represent values, not actions.
+But machine instructions never produce values; they are meaningful only
+for their side effects on the state of the machine.  Special expression
+codes are used to represent side effects.
+
+   The body of an instruction is always one of these side effect codes;
+the codes described above, which represent values, appear only as the
+operands of these.
+
+`(set LVAL X)'
+     Represents the action of storing the value of X into the place
+     represented by LVAL.  LVAL must be an expression representing a
+     place that can be stored in: `reg' (or `subreg' or
+     `strict_low_part'), `mem', `pc' or `cc0'.
+
+     If LVAL is a `reg', `subreg' or `mem', it has a machine mode; then
+     X must be valid for that mode.
+
+     If LVAL is a `reg' whose machine mode is less than the full width
+     of the register, then it means that the part of the register
+     specified by the machine mode is given the specified value and the
+     rest of the register receives an undefined value.  Likewise, if
+     LVAL is a `subreg' whose machine mode is narrower than the mode of
+     the register, the rest of the register can be changed in an
+     undefined way.
+
+     If LVAL is a `strict_low_part' of a `subreg', then the part of the
+     register specified by the machine mode of the `subreg' is given
+     the value X and the rest of the register is not changed.
+
+     If LVAL is `(cc0)', it has no machine mode, and X may be either a
+     `compare' expression or a value that may have any mode.  The
+     latter case represents a "test" instruction.  The expression `(set
+     (cc0) (reg:M N))' is equivalent to `(set (cc0) (compare (reg:M N)
+     (const_int 0)))'.  Use the former expression to save space during
+     the compilation.
+
+     If LVAL is `(pc)', we have a jump instruction, and the
+     possibilities for X are very limited.  It may be a `label_ref'
+     expression (unconditional jump).  It may be an `if_then_else'
+     (conditional jump), in which case either the second or the third
+     operand must be `(pc)' (for the case which does not jump) and the
+     other of the two must be a `label_ref' (for the case which does
+     jump).  X may also be a `mem' or `(plus:SI (pc) Y)', where Y may
+     be a `reg' or a `mem'; these unusual patterns are used to
+     represent jumps through branch tables.
+
+     If LVAL is neither `(cc0)' nor `(pc)', the mode of LVAL must not
+     be `VOIDmode' and the mode of X must be valid for the mode of LVAL.
+
+     LVAL is customarily accessed with the `SET_DEST' macro and X with
+     the `SET_SRC' macro.
+
+`(return)'
+     As the sole expression in a pattern, represents a return from the
+     current function, on machines where this can be done with one
+     instruction, such as Vaxes.  On machines where a multi-instruction
+     "epilogue" must be executed in order to return from the function,
+     returning is done by jumping to a label which precedes the
+     epilogue, and the `return' expression code is never used.
+
+     Inside an `if_then_else' expression, represents the value to be
+     placed in `pc' to return to the caller.
+
+     Note that an insn pattern of `(return)' is logically equivalent to
+     `(set (pc) (return))', but the latter form is never used.
+
+`(call FUNCTION NARGS)'
+     Represents a function call.  FUNCTION is a `mem' expression whose
+     address is the address of the function to be called.  NARGS is an
+     expression which can be used for two purposes: on some machines it
+     represents the number of bytes of stack argument; on others, it
+     represents the number of argument registers.
+
+     Each machine has a standard machine mode which FUNCTION must have.
+     The machine description defines macro `FUNCTION_MODE' to expand
+     into the requisite mode name.  The purpose of this mode is to
+     specify what kind of addressing is allowed, on machines where the
+     allowed kinds of addressing depend on the machine mode being
+     addressed.
+
+`(clobber X)'
+     Represents the storing or possible storing of an unpredictable,
+     undescribed value into X, which must be a `reg', `scratch' or
+     `mem' expression.
+
+     One place this is used is in string instructions that store
+     standard values into particular hard registers.  It may not be
+     worth the trouble to describe the values that are stored, but it
+     is essential to inform the compiler that the registers will be
+     altered, lest it attempt to keep data in them across the string
+     instruction.
+
+     If X is `(mem:BLK (const_int 0))', it means that all memory
+     locations must be presumed clobbered.
+
+     Note that the machine description classifies certain hard
+     registers as "call-clobbered".  All function call instructions are
+     assumed by default to clobber these registers, so there is no need
+     to use `clobber' expressions to indicate this fact.  Also, each
+     function call is assumed to have the potential to alter any memory
+     location, unless the function is declared `const'.
+
+     If the last group of expressions in a `parallel' are each a
+     `clobber' expression whose arguments are `reg' or `match_scratch'
+     (*note RTL Template::.) expressions, the combiner phase can add
+     the appropriate `clobber' expressions to an insn it has
+     constructed when doing so will cause a pattern to be matched.
+
+     This feature can be used, for example, on a machine that whose
+     multiply and add instructions don't use an MQ register but which
+     has an add-accumulate instruction that does clobber the MQ
+     register.  Similarly, a combined instruction might require a
+     temporary register while the constituent instructions might not.
+
+     When a `clobber' expression for a register appears inside a
+     `parallel' with other side effects, the register allocator
+     guarantees that the register is unoccupied both before and after
+     that insn.  However, the reload phase may allocate a register used
+     for one of the inputs unless the `&' constraint is specified for
+     the selected alternative (*note Modifiers::.).  You can clobber
+     either a specific hard register, a pseudo register, or a `scratch'
+     expression; in the latter two cases, GNU CC will allocate a hard
+     register that is available there for use as a temporary.
+
+     For instructions that require a temporary register, you should use
+     `scratch' instead of a pseudo-register because this will allow the
+     combiner phase to add the `clobber' when required.  You do this by
+     coding (`clobber' (`match_scratch' ...)).  If you do clobber a
+     pseudo register, use one which appears nowhere else--generate a
+     new one each time.  Otherwise, you may confuse CSE.
+
+     There is one other known use for clobbering a pseudo register in a
+     `parallel': when one of the input operands of the insn is also
+     clobbered by the insn.  In this case, using the same pseudo
+     register in the clobber and elsewhere in the insn produces the
+     expected results.
+
+`(use X)'
+     Represents the use of the value of X.  It indicates that the value
+     in X at this point in the program is needed, even though it may
+     not be apparent why this is so.  Therefore, the compiler will not
+     attempt to delete previous instructions whose only effect is to
+     store a value in X.  X must be a `reg' expression.
+
+     During the reload phase, an insn that has a `use' as pattern can
+     carry a reg_equal note.  These `use' insns will be deleted before
+     the reload phase exits.
+
+     During the delayed branch scheduling phase, X may be an insn.
+     This indicates that X previously was located at this place in the
+     code and its data dependencies need to be taken into account.
+     These `use' insns will be deleted before the delayed branch
+     scheduling phase exits.
+
+`(parallel [X0 X1 ...])'
+     Represents several side effects performed in parallel.  The square
+     brackets stand for a vector; the operand of `parallel' is a vector
+     of expressions.  X0, X1 and so on are individual side effect
+     expressions--expressions of code `set', `call', `return',
+     `clobber' or `use'.
+
+     "In parallel" means that first all the values used in the
+     individual side-effects are computed, and second all the actual
+     side-effects are performed.  For example,
+
+          (parallel [(set (reg:SI 1) (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)))
+                     (set (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)) (reg:SI 1))])
+
+     says unambiguously that the values of hard register 1 and the
+     memory location addressed by it are interchanged.  In both places
+     where `(reg:SI 1)' appears as a memory address it refers to the
+     value in register 1 *before* the execution of the insn.
+
+     It follows that it is *incorrect* to use `parallel' and expect the
+     result of one `set' to be available for the next one.  For
+     example, people sometimes attempt to represent a jump-if-zero
+     instruction this way:
+
+          (parallel [(set (cc0) (reg:SI 34))
+                     (set (pc) (if_then_else
+                                  (eq (cc0) (const_int 0))
+                                  (label_ref ...)
+                                  (pc)))])
+
+     But this is incorrect, because it says that the jump condition
+     depends on the condition code value *before* this instruction, not
+     on the new value that is set by this instruction.
+
+     Peephole optimization, which takes place together with final
+     assembly code output, can produce insns whose patterns consist of
+     a `parallel' whose elements are the operands needed to output the
+     resulting assembler code--often `reg', `mem' or constant
+     expressions.  This would not be well-formed RTL at any other stage
+     in compilation, but it is ok then because no further optimization
+     remains to be done.  However, the definition of the macro
+     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC', if any, must deal with such insns if you
+     define any peephole optimizations.
+
+`(sequence [INSNS ...])'
+     Represents a sequence of insns.  Each of the INSNS that appears in
+     the vector is suitable for appearing in the chain of insns, so it
+     must be an `insn', `jump_insn', `call_insn', `code_label',
+     `barrier' or `note'.
+
+     A `sequence' RTX is never placed in an actual insn during RTL
+     generation.  It represents the sequence of insns that result from a
+     `define_expand' *before* those insns are passed to `emit_insn' to
+     insert them in the chain of insns.  When actually inserted, the
+     individual sub-insns are separated out and the `sequence' is
+     forgotten.
+
+     After delay-slot scheduling is completed, an insn and all the
+     insns that reside in its delay slots are grouped together into a
+     `sequence'.  The insn requiring the delay slot is the first insn
+     in the vector; subsequent insns are to be placed in the delay slot.
+
+     `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' is set on an insn in a delay slot to
+     indicate that a branch insn should be used that will conditionally
+     annul the effect of the insns in the delay slots.  In such a case,
+     `INSN_FROM_TARGET_P' indicates that the insn is from the target of
+     the branch and should be executed only if the branch is taken;
+     otherwise the insn should be executed only if the branch is not
+     taken.  *Note Delay Slots::.
+
+   These expression codes appear in place of a side effect, as the body
+of an insn, though strictly speaking they do not always describe side
+effects as such:
+
+`(asm_input S)'
+     Represents literal assembler code as described by the string S.
+
+`(unspec [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
+`(unspec_volatile [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
+     Represents a machine-specific operation on OPERANDS.  INDEX
+     selects between multiple machine-specific operations.
+     `unspec_volatile' is used for volatile operations and operations
+     that may trap; `unspec' is used for other operations.
+
+     These codes may appear inside a `pattern' of an insn, inside a
+     `parallel', or inside an expression.
+
+`(addr_vec:M [LR0 LR1 ...])'
+     Represents a table of jump addresses.  The vector elements LR0,
+     etc., are `label_ref' expressions.  The mode M specifies how much
+     space is given to each address; normally M would be `Pmode'.
+
+`(addr_diff_vec:M BASE [LR0 LR1 ...] MIN MAX FLAGS)'
+     Represents a table of jump addresses expressed as offsets from
+     BASE.  The vector elements LR0, etc., are `label_ref' expressions
+     and so is BASE.  The mode M specifies how much space is given to
+     each address-difference.  MIN and MAX are set up by branch
+     shortening and hold a label with a minimum and a maximum address,
+     respectively.  FLAGS indicates the relative position of BASE, MIN
+     and MAX to the cointaining insn and of MIN and MAX to BASE.  See
+     rtl.def for details.

+
+Embedded Side-Effects on Addresses
+==================================
+
+   Six special side-effect expression codes appear as memory addresses.
+
+`(pre_dec:M X)'
+     Represents the side effect of decrementing X by a standard amount
+     and represents also the value that X has after being decremented.
+     X must be a `reg' or `mem', but most machines allow only a `reg'.
+     M must be the machine mode for pointers on the machine in use.
+     The amount X is decremented by is the length in bytes of the
+     machine mode of the containing memory reference of which this
+     expression serves as the address.  Here is an example of its use:
+
+          (mem:DF (pre_dec:SI (reg:SI 39)))
+
+     This says to decrement pseudo register 39 by the length of a
+     `DFmode' value and use the result to address a `DFmode' value.
+
+`(pre_inc:M X)'
+     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.
+
+`(post_dec:M X)'
+     Represents the same side effect as `pre_dec' but a different
+     value.  The value represented here is the value X has before being
+     decremented.
+
+`(post_inc:M X)'
+     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.
+
+`(post_modify:M X Y)'
+     Represents the side effect of setting X to Y and represents X
+     before X is modified.  X must be a `reg' or `mem', but most
+     machines allow only a `reg'.  M must be the machine mode for
+     pointers on the machine in use.  The amount X is decremented by is
+     the length in bytes of the machine mode of the containing memory
+     reference of which this expression serves as the address.  Note
+     that this is not currently implemented.
+
+     The expression Y must be one of three forms:
+          `(plus:M X Z)', `(minus:M X Z)', or `(plus:M X I)', where Z
+     is an index register and I is a constant.
+
+     Here is an example of its use:
+
+          (mem:SF (post_modify:SI (reg:SI 42) (plus (reg:SI 42) (reg:SI 48))))
+
+     This says to modify pseudo register 42 by adding the contents of
+     pseudo register 48 to it, after the use of what ever 42 points to.
+
+`(pre_modify:M X EXPR)'
+     Similar except side effects happen before the use.
+
+   These embedded side effect expressions must be used with care.
+Instruction patterns may not use them.  Until the `flow' pass of the
+compiler, they may occur only to represent pushes onto the stack.  The
+`flow' pass finds cases where registers are incremented or decremented
+in one instruction and used as an address shortly before or after;
+these cases are then transformed to use pre- or post-increment or
+-decrement.
+
+   If a register used as the operand of these expressions is used in
+another address in an insn, the original value of the register is used.
+Uses of the register outside of an address are not permitted within the
+same insn as a use in an embedded side effect expression because such
+insns behave differently on different machines and hence must be treated
+as ambiguous and disallowed.
+
+   An instruction that can be represented with an embedded side effect
+could also be represented using `parallel' containing an additional
+`set' to describe how the address register is altered.  This is not
+done because machines that allow these operations at all typically
+allow them wherever a memory address is called for.  Describing them as
+additional parallel stores would require doubling the number of entries
+in the machine description.

+
+Assembler Instructions as Expressions
+=====================================
+
+   The RTX code `asm_operands' represents a value produced by a
+user-specified assembler instruction.  It is used to represent an `asm'
+statement with arguments.  An `asm' statement with a single output
+operand, like this:
+
+     asm ("foo %1,%2,%0" : "=a" (outputvar) : "g" (x + y), "di" (*z));
+
+is represented using a single `asm_operands' RTX which represents the
+value that is stored in `outputvar':
+
+     (set RTX-FOR-OUTPUTVAR
+          (asm_operands "foo %1,%2,%0" "a" 0
+                        [RTX-FOR-ADDITION-RESULT RTX-FOR-*Z]
+                        [(asm_input:M1 "g")
+                         (asm_input:M2 "di")]))
+
+Here the operands of the `asm_operands' RTX are the assembler template
+string, the output-operand's constraint, the index-number of the output
+operand among the output operands specified, a vector of input operand
+RTX's, and a vector of input-operand modes and constraints.  The mode
+M1 is the mode of the sum `x+y'; M2 is that of `*z'.
+
+   When an `asm' statement has multiple output values, its insn has
+several such `set' RTX's inside of a `parallel'.  Each `set' contains a
+`asm_operands'; all of these share the same assembler template and
+vectors, but each contains the constraint for the respective output
+operand.  They are also distinguished by the output-operand index
+number, which is 0, 1, ... for successive output operands.

+
+Insns
+=====
+
+   The RTL representation of the code for a function is a doubly-linked
+chain of objects called "insns".  Insns are expressions with special
+codes that are used for no other purpose.  Some insns are actual
+instructions; others represent dispatch tables for `switch' statements;
+others represent labels to jump to or various sorts of declarative
+information.
+
+   In addition to its own specific data, each insn must have a unique
+id-number that distinguishes it from all other insns in the current
+function (after delayed branch scheduling, copies of an insn with the
+same id-number may be present in multiple places in a function, but
+these copies will always be identical and will only appear inside a
+`sequence'), and chain pointers to the preceding and following insns.
+These three fields occupy the same position in every insn, independent
+of the expression code of the insn.  They could be accessed with `XEXP'
+and `XINT', but instead three special macros are always used:
+
+`INSN_UID (I)'
+     Accesses the unique id of insn I.
+
+`PREV_INSN (I)'
+     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn preceding I.  If I is the
+     first insn, this is a null pointer.
+
+`NEXT_INSN (I)'
+     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn following I.  If I is the
+     last insn, this is a null pointer.
+
+   The first insn in the chain is obtained by calling `get_insns'; the
+last insn is the result of calling `get_last_insn'.  Within the chain
+delimited by these insns, the `NEXT_INSN' and `PREV_INSN' pointers must
+always correspond: if INSN is not the first insn,
+
+     NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN)) == INSN
+
+is always true and if INSN is not the last insn,
+
+     PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (INSN)) == INSN
+
+is always true.
+
+   After delay slot scheduling, some of the insns in the chain might be
+`sequence' expressions, which contain a vector of insns.  The value of
+`NEXT_INSN' in all but the last of these insns is the next insn in the
+vector; the value of `NEXT_INSN' of the last insn in the vector is the
+same as the value of `NEXT_INSN' for the `sequence' in which it is
+contained.  Similar rules apply for `PREV_INSN'.
+
+   This means that the above invariants are not necessarily true for
+insns inside `sequence' expressions.  Specifically, if INSN is the
+first insn in a `sequence', `NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN))' is the insn
+containing the `sequence' expression, as is the value of `PREV_INSN
+(NEXT_INSN (INSN))' is INSN is the last insn in the `sequence'
+expression.  You can use these expressions to find the containing
+`sequence' expression.
+
+   Every insn has one of the following six expression codes:
+
+`insn'
+     The expression code `insn' is used for instructions that do not
+     jump and do not do function calls.  `sequence' expressions are
+     always contained in insns with code `insn' even if one of those
+     insns should jump or do function calls.
+
+     Insns with code `insn' have four additional fields beyond the three
+     mandatory ones listed above.  These four are described in a table
+     below.
+
+`jump_insn'
+     The expression code `jump_insn' is used for instructions that may
+     jump (or, more generally, may contain `label_ref' expressions).  If
+     there is an instruction to return from the current function, it is
+     recorded as a `jump_insn'.
+
+     `jump_insn' insns have the same extra fields as `insn' insns,
+     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
+     `JUMP_LABEL' which is defined once jump optimization has completed.
+
+     For simple conditional and unconditional jumps, this field
+     contains the `code_label' to which this insn will (possibly
+     conditionally) branch.  In a more complex jump, `JUMP_LABEL'
+     records one of the labels that the insn refers to; the only way to
+     find the others is to scan the entire body of the insn.
+
+     Return insns count as jumps, but since they do not refer to any
+     labels, they have zero in the `JUMP_LABEL' field.
+
+`call_insn'
+     The expression code `call_insn' is used for instructions that may
+     do function calls.  It is important to distinguish these
+     instructions because they imply that certain registers and memory
+     locations may be altered unpredictably.
+
+     `call_insn' insns have the same extra fields as `insn' insns,
+     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
+     `CALL_INSN_FUNCTION_USAGE', which contains a list (chain of
+     `expr_list' expressions) containing `use' and `clobber'
+     expressions that denote hard registers used or clobbered by the
+     called function.  A register specified in a `clobber' in this list
+     is modified *after* the execution of the `call_insn', while a
+     register in a `clobber' in the body of the `call_insn' is
+     clobbered before the insn completes execution.  `clobber'
+     expressions in this list augment registers specified in
+     `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register Basics::.).
+
+`code_label'
+     A `code_label' insn represents a label that a jump insn can jump
+     to.  It contains two special fields of data in addition to the
+     three standard ones.  `CODE_LABEL_NUMBER' is used to hold the
+     "label number", a number that identifies this label uniquely among
+     all the labels in the compilation (not just in the current
+     function).  Ultimately, the label is represented in the assembler
+     output as an assembler label, usually of the form `LN' where N is
+     the label number.
+
+     When a `code_label' appears in an RTL expression, it normally
+     appears within a `label_ref' which represents the address of the
+     label, as a number.
+
+     The field `LABEL_NUSES' is only defined once the jump optimization
+     phase is completed and contains the number of times this label is
+     referenced in the current function.
+
+`barrier'
+     Barriers are placed in the instruction stream when control cannot
+     flow past them.  They are placed after unconditional jump
+     instructions to indicate that the jumps are unconditional and
+     after calls to `volatile' functions, which do not return (e.g.,
+     `exit').  They contain no information beyond the three standard
+     fields.
+
+`note'
+     `note' insns are used to represent additional debugging and
+     declarative information.  They contain two nonstandard fields, an
+     integer which is accessed with the macro `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' and a
+     string accessed with `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE'.
+
+     If `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is positive, the note represents the
+     position of a source line and `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' is the source
+     file name that the line came from.  These notes control generation
+     of line number data in the assembler output.
+
+     Otherwise, `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is not really a line number but a
+     code with one of the following values (and `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' must
+     contain a null pointer):
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_DELETED'
+          Such a note is completely ignorable.  Some passes of the
+          compiler delete insns by altering them into notes of this
+          kind.
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_BEG'
+    `NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_END'
+          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
+          and end of a level of scoping of variable names.  They
+          control the output of debugging information.
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_BEG'
+    `NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_END'
+          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
+          and end of a level of scoping for exception handling.
+          `NOTE_BLOCK_NUMBER' identifies which `CODE_LABEL' is
+          associated with the given region.
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG'
+    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END'
+          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
+          and end of a `while' or `for' loop.  They enable the loop
+          optimizer to find loops quickly.
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_CONT'
+          Appears at the place in a loop that `continue' statements
+          jump to.
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP'
+          This note indicates the place in a loop where the exit test
+          begins for those loops in which the exit test has been
+          duplicated.  This position becomes another virtual start of
+          the loop when considering loop invariants.
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_FUNCTION_END'
+          Appears near the end of the function body, just before the
+          label that `return' statements jump to (on machine where a
+          single instruction does not suffice for returning).  This
+          note may be deleted by jump optimization.
+
+    `NOTE_INSN_SETJMP'
+          Appears following each call to `setjmp' or a related function.
+
+     These codes are printed symbolically when they appear in debugging
+     dumps.
+
+   The machine mode of an insn is normally `VOIDmode', but some phases
+use the mode for various purposes.
+
+   The common subexpression elimination pass sets the mode of an insn to
+`QImode' when it is the first insn in a block that has already been
+processed.
+
+   The second Haifa scheduling pass, for targets that can multiple
+issue, sets the mode of an insn to `TImode' when it is believed that the
+instruction begins an issue group.  That is, when the instruction
+cannot issue simultaneously with the previous.  This may be relied on
+by later passes, in particular machine-dependant reorg.
+
+   Here is a table of the extra fields of `insn', `jump_insn' and
+`call_insn' insns:
+
+`PATTERN (I)'
+     An expression for the side effect performed by this insn.  This
+     must be one of the following codes: `set', `call', `use',
+     `clobber', `return', `asm_input', `asm_output', `addr_vec',
+     `addr_diff_vec', `trap_if', `unspec', `unspec_volatile',
+     `parallel', or `sequence'.  If it is a `parallel', each element of
+     the `parallel' must be one these codes, except that `parallel'
+     expressions cannot be nested and `addr_vec' and `addr_diff_vec'
+     are not permitted inside a `parallel' expression.
+
+`INSN_CODE (I)'
+     An integer that says which pattern in the machine description
+     matches this insn, or -1 if the matching has not yet been
+     attempted.
+
+     Such matching is never attempted and this field remains -1 on an
+     insn whose pattern consists of a single `use', `clobber',
+     `asm_input', `addr_vec' or `addr_diff_vec' expression.
+
+     Matching is also never attempted on insns that result from an `asm'
+     statement.  These contain at least one `asm_operands' expression.
+     The function `asm_noperands' returns a non-negative value for such
+     insns.
+
+     In the debugging output, this field is printed as a number
+     followed by a symbolic representation that locates the pattern in
+     the `md' file as some small positive or negative offset from a
+     named pattern.
+
+`LOG_LINKS (I)'
+     A list (chain of `insn_list' expressions) giving information about
+     dependencies between instructions within a basic block.  Neither a
+     jump nor a label may come between the related insns.
+
+`REG_NOTES (I)'
+     A list (chain of `expr_list' and `insn_list' expressions) giving
+     miscellaneous information about the insn.  It is often information
+     pertaining to the registers used in this insn.
+
+   The `LOG_LINKS' field of an insn is a chain of `insn_list'
+expressions.  Each of these has two operands: the first is an insn, and
+the second is another `insn_list' expression (the next one in the
+chain).  The last `insn_list' in the chain has a null pointer as second
+operand.  The significant thing about the chain is which insns appear
+in it (as first operands of `insn_list' expressions).  Their order is
+not significant.
+
+   This list is originally set up by the flow analysis pass; it is a
+null pointer until then.  Flow only adds links for those data
+dependencies which can be used for instruction combination.  For each
+insn, the flow analysis pass adds a link to insns which store into
+registers values that are used for the first time in this insn.  The
+instruction scheduling pass adds extra links so that every dependence
+will be represented.  Links represent data dependencies,
+antidependencies and output dependencies; the machine mode of the link
+distinguishes these three types: antidependencies have mode
+`REG_DEP_ANTI', output dependencies have mode `REG_DEP_OUTPUT', and
+data dependencies have mode `VOIDmode'.
+
+   The `REG_NOTES' field of an insn is a chain similar to the
+`LOG_LINKS' field but it includes `expr_list' expressions in addition
+to `insn_list' expressions.  There are several kinds of register notes,
+which are distinguished by the machine mode, which in a register note
+is really understood as being an `enum reg_note'.  The first operand OP
+of the note is data whose meaning depends on the kind of note.
+
+   The macro `REG_NOTE_KIND (X)' returns the kind of register note.
+Its counterpart, the macro `PUT_REG_NOTE_KIND (X, NEWKIND)' sets the
+register note type of X to be NEWKIND.
+
+   Register notes are of three classes: They may say something about an
+input to an insn, they may say something about an output of an insn, or
+they may create a linkage between two insns.  There are also a set of
+values that are only used in `LOG_LINKS'.
+
+   These register notes annotate inputs to an insn:
+
+`REG_DEAD'
+     The value in OP dies in this insn; that is to say, altering the
+     value immediately after this insn would not affect the future
+     behavior of the program.
+
+     This does not necessarily mean that the register OP has no useful
+     value after this insn since it may also be an output of the insn.
+     In such a case, however, a `REG_DEAD' note would be redundant and
+     is usually not present until after the reload pass, but no code
+     relies on this fact.
+
+`REG_INC'
+     The register OP is incremented (or decremented; at this level
+     there is no distinction) by an embedded side effect inside this
+     insn.  This means it appears in a `post_inc', `pre_inc',
+     `post_dec' or `pre_dec' expression.
+
+`REG_NONNEG'
+     The register OP is known to have a nonnegative value when this
+     insn is reached.  This is used so that decrement and branch until
+     zero instructions, such as the m68k dbra, can be matched.
+
+     The `REG_NONNEG' note is added to insns only if the machine
+     description has a `decrement_and_branch_until_zero' pattern.
+
+`REG_NO_CONFLICT'
+     This insn does not cause a conflict between OP and the item being
+     set by this insn even though it might appear that it does.  In
+     other words, if the destination register and OP could otherwise be
+     assigned the same register, this insn does not prevent that
+     assignment.
+
+     Insns with this note are usually part of a block that begins with a
+     `clobber' insn specifying a multi-word pseudo register (which will
+     be the output of the block), a group of insns that each set one
+     word of the value and have the `REG_NO_CONFLICT' note attached,
+     and a final insn that copies the output to itself with an attached
+     `REG_EQUAL' note giving the expression being computed.  This block
+     is encapsulated with `REG_LIBCALL' and `REG_RETVAL' notes on the
+     first and last insns, respectively.
+
+`REG_LABEL'
+     This insn uses OP, a `code_label', but is not a `jump_insn'.  The
+     presence of this note allows jump optimization to be aware that OP
+     is, in fact, being used.
+
+   The following notes describe attributes of outputs of an insn:
+
+`REG_EQUIV'
+`REG_EQUAL'
+     This note is only valid on an insn that sets only one register and
+     indicates that that register will be equal to OP at run time; the
+     scope of this equivalence differs between the two types of notes.
+     The value which the insn explicitly copies into the register may
+     look different from OP, but they will be equal at run time.  If the
+     output of the single `set' is a `strict_low_part' expression, the
+     note refers to the register that is contained in `SUBREG_REG' of
+     the `subreg' expression.
+
+     For `REG_EQUIV', the register is equivalent to OP throughout the
+     entire function, and could validly be replaced in all its
+     occurrences by OP.  ("Validly" here refers to the data flow of the
+     program; simple replacement may make some insns invalid.)  For
+     example, when a constant is loaded into a register that is never
+     assigned any other value, this kind of note is used.
+
+     When a parameter is copied into a pseudo-register at entry to a
+     function, a note of this kind records that the register is
+     equivalent to the stack slot where the parameter was passed.
+     Although in this case the register may be set by other insns, it
+     is still valid to replace the register by the stack slot
+     throughout the function.
+
+     A `REG_EQUIV' note is also used on an instruction which copies a
+     register parameter into a pseudo-register at entry to a function,
+     if there is a stack slot where that parameter could be stored.
+     Although other insns may set the pseudo-register, it is valid for
+     the compiler to replace the pseudo-register by stack slot
+     throughout the function, provided the compiler ensures that the
+     stack slot is properly initialized by making the replacement in
+     the initial copy instruction as well.  This is used on machines
+     for which the calling convention allocates stack space for
+     register parameters.  See `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' in *Note Stack
+     Arguments::.
+
+     In the case of `REG_EQUAL', the register that is set by this insn
+     will be equal to OP at run time at the end of this insn but not
+     necessarily elsewhere in the function.  In this case, OP is
+     typically an arithmetic expression.  For example, when a sequence
+     of insns such as a library call is used to perform an arithmetic
+     operation, this kind of note is attached to the insn that produces
+     or copies the final value.
+
+     These two notes are used in different ways by the compiler passes.
+     `REG_EQUAL' is used by passes prior to register allocation (such as
+     common subexpression elimination and loop optimization) to tell
+     them how to think of that value.  `REG_EQUIV' notes are used by
+     register allocation to indicate that there is an available
+     substitute expression (either a constant or a `mem' expression for
+     the location of a parameter on the stack) that may be used in
+     place of a register if insufficient registers are available.
+
+     Except for stack homes for parameters, which are indicated by a
+     `REG_EQUIV' note and are not useful to the early optimization
+     passes and pseudo registers that are equivalent to a memory
+     location throughout there entire life, which is not detected until
+     later in the compilation, all equivalences are initially indicated
+     by an attached `REG_EQUAL' note.  In the early stages of register
+     allocation, a `REG_EQUAL' note is changed into a `REG_EQUIV' note
+     if OP is a constant and the insn represents the only set of its
+     destination register.
+
+     Thus, compiler passes prior to register allocation need only check
+     for `REG_EQUAL' notes and passes subsequent to register allocation
+     need only check for `REG_EQUIV' notes.
+
+`REG_UNUSED'
+     The register OP being set by this insn will not be used in a
+     subsequent insn.  This differs from a `REG_DEAD' note, which
+     indicates that the value in an input will not be used subsequently.
+     These two notes are independent; both may be present for the same
+     register.
+
+`REG_WAS_0'
+     The single output of this insn contained zero before this insn.
+     OP is the insn that set it to zero.  You can rely on this note if
+     it is present and OP has not been deleted or turned into a `note';
+     its absence implies nothing.
+
+   These notes describe linkages between insns.  They occur in pairs:
+one insn has one of a pair of notes that points to a second insn, which
+has the inverse note pointing back to the first insn.
+
+`REG_RETVAL'
+     This insn copies the value of a multi-insn sequence (for example, a
+     library call), and OP is the first insn of the sequence (for a
+     library call, the first insn that was generated to set up the
+     arguments for the library call).
+
+     Loop optimization uses this note to treat such a sequence as a
+     single operation for code motion purposes and flow analysis uses
+     this note to delete such sequences whose results are dead.
+
+     A `REG_EQUAL' note will also usually be attached to this insn to
+     provide the expression being computed by the sequence.
+
+     These notes will be deleted after reload, since they are no longer
+     accurate or useful.
+
+`REG_LIBCALL'
+     This is the inverse of `REG_RETVAL': it is placed on the first
+     insn of a multi-insn sequence, and it points to the last one.
+
+     These notes are deleted after reload, since they are no longer
+     useful or accurate.
+
+`REG_CC_SETTER'
+`REG_CC_USER'
+     On machines that use `cc0', the insns which set and use `cc0' set
+     and use `cc0' are adjacent.  However, when branch delay slot
+     filling is done, this may no longer be true.  In this case a
+     `REG_CC_USER' note will be placed on the insn setting `cc0' to
+     point to the insn using `cc0' and a `REG_CC_SETTER' note will be
+     placed on the insn using `cc0' to point to the insn setting `cc0'.
+
+   These values are only used in the `LOG_LINKS' field, and indicate
+the type of dependency that each link represents.  Links which indicate
+a data dependence (a read after write dependence) do not use any code,
+they simply have mode `VOIDmode', and are printed without any
+descriptive text.
+
+`REG_DEP_ANTI'
+     This indicates an anti dependence (a write after read dependence).
+
+`REG_DEP_OUTPUT'
+     This indicates an output dependence (a write after write
+     dependence).
+
+   These notes describe information gathered from gcov profile data.
+They are stored in the `REG_NOTES' field of an insn as an `expr_list'.
+
+`REG_EXEC_COUNT'
+     This is used to indicate the number of times a basic block was
+     executed according to the profile data.  The note is attached to
+     the first insn in the basic block.
+
+`REG_BR_PROB'
+     This is used to specify the ratio of branches to non-branches of a
+     branch insn according to the profile data.  The value is stored as
+     a value between 0 and REG_BR_PROB_BASE; larger values indicate a
+     higher probability that the branch will be taken.
+
+`REG_BR_PRED'
+     These notes are found in JUMP insns after delayed branch scheduling
+     has taken place.  They indicate both the direction and the
+     likelyhood of the JUMP.  The format is a bitmask of ATTR_FLAG_*
+     values.
+
+`REG_FRAME_RELATED_EXPR'
+     This is used on an RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P insn wherein the attached
+     expression is used in place of the actual insn pattern.  This is
+     done in cases where the pattern is either complex or misleading.
+
+   For convenience, the machine mode in an `insn_list' or `expr_list'
+is printed using these symbolic codes in debugging dumps.
+
+   The only difference between the expression codes `insn_list' and
+`expr_list' is that the first operand of an `insn_list' is assumed to
+be an insn and is printed in debugging dumps as the insn's unique id;
+the first operand of an `expr_list' is printed in the ordinary way as
+an expression.

+
+RTL Representation of Function-Call Insns
+=========================================
+
+   Insns that call subroutines have the RTL expression code `call_insn'.
+These insns must satisfy special rules, and their bodies must use a
+special RTL expression code, `call'.
+
+   A `call' expression has two operands, as follows:
+
+     (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES)
+
+Here NBYTES is an operand that represents the number of bytes of
+argument data being passed to the subroutine, FM is a machine mode
+(which must equal as the definition of the `FUNCTION_MODE' macro in the
+machine description) and ADDR represents the address of the subroutine.
+
+   For a subroutine that returns no value, the `call' expression as
+shown above is the entire body of the insn, except that the insn might
+also contain `use' or `clobber' expressions.
+
+   For a subroutine that returns a value whose mode is not `BLKmode',
+the value is returned in a hard register.  If this register's number is
+R, then the body of the call insn looks like this:
+
+     (set (reg:M R)
+          (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES))
+
+This RTL expression makes it clear (to the optimizer passes) that the
+appropriate register receives a useful value in this insn.
+
+   When a subroutine returns a `BLKmode' value, it is handled by
+passing to the subroutine the address of a place to store the value.
+So the call insn itself does not "return" any value, and it has the
+same RTL form as a call that returns nothing.
+
+   On some machines, the call instruction itself clobbers some register,
+for example to contain the return address.  `call_insn' insns on these
+machines should have a body which is a `parallel' that contains both
+the `call' expression and `clobber' expressions that indicate which
+registers are destroyed.  Similarly, if the call instruction requires
+some register other than the stack pointer that is not explicitly
+mentioned it its RTL, a `use' subexpression should mention that
+register.
+
+   Functions that are called are assumed to modify all registers listed
+in the configuration macro `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register
+Basics::.) and, with the exception of `const' functions and library
+calls, to modify all of memory.
+
+   Insns containing just `use' expressions directly precede the
+`call_insn' insn to indicate which registers contain inputs to the
+function.  Similarly, if registers other than those in
+`CALL_USED_REGISTERS' are clobbered by the called function, insns
+containing a single `clobber' follow immediately after the call to
+indicate which registers.

+
+Structure Sharing Assumptions
+=============================
+
+   The compiler assumes that certain kinds of RTL expressions are
+unique; there do not exist two distinct objects representing the same
+value.  In other cases, it makes an opposite assumption: that no RTL
+expression object of a certain kind appears in more than one place in
+the containing structure.
+
+   These assumptions refer to a single function; except for the RTL
+objects that describe global variables and external functions, and a
+few standard objects such as small integer constants, no RTL objects
+are common to two functions.
+
+   * Each pseudo-register has only a single `reg' object to represent
+     it, and therefore only a single machine mode.
+
+   * For any symbolic label, there is only one `symbol_ref' object
+     referring to it.
+
+   * There is only one `const_int' expression with value 0, only one
+     with value 1, and only one with value -1.  Some other integer
+     values are also stored uniquely.
+
+   * There is only one `pc' expression.
+
+   * There is only one `cc0' expression.
+
+   * There is only one `const_double' expression with value 0 for each
+     floating point mode.  Likewise for values 1 and 2.
+
+   * No `label_ref' or `scratch' appears in more than one place in the
+     RTL structure; in other words, it is safe to do a tree-walk of all
+     the insns in the function and assume that each time a `label_ref'
+     or `scratch' is seen it is distinct from all others that are seen.
+
+   * Only one `mem' object is normally created for each static variable
+     or stack slot, so these objects are frequently shared in all the
+     places they appear.  However, separate but equal objects for these
+     variables are occasionally made.
+
+   * When a single `asm' statement has multiple output operands, a
+     distinct `asm_operands' expression is made for each output operand.
+     However, these all share the vector which contains the sequence of
+     input operands.  This sharing is used later on to test whether two
+     `asm_operands' expressions come from the same statement, so all
+     optimizations must carefully preserve the sharing if they copy the
+     vector at all.
+
+   * No RTL object appears in more than one place in the RTL structure
+     except as described above.  Many passes of the compiler rely on
+     this by assuming that they can modify RTL objects in place without
+     unwanted side-effects on other insns.
+
+   * During initial RTL generation, shared structure is freely
+     introduced.  After all the RTL for a function has been generated,
+     all shared structure is copied by `unshare_all_rtl' in
+     `emit-rtl.c', after which the above rules are guaranteed to be
+     followed.
+
+   * During the combiner pass, shared structure within an insn can exist
+     temporarily.  However, the shared structure is copied before the
+     combiner is finished with the insn.  This is done by calling
+     `copy_rtx_if_shared', which is a subroutine of `unshare_all_rtl'.

+
+Reading RTL
+===========
+
+   To read an RTL object from a file, call `read_rtx'.  It takes one
+argument, a stdio stream, and returns a single RTL object.
+
+   Reading RTL from a file is very slow.  This is not currently a
+problem since reading RTL occurs only as part of building the compiler.
+
+   People frequently have the idea of using RTL stored as text in a
+file as an interface between a language front end and the bulk of GNU
+CC.  This idea is not feasible.
+
+   GNU CC was designed to use RTL internally only.  Correct RTL for a
+given program is very dependent on the particular target machine.  And
+the RTL does not contain all the information about the program.
+
+   The proper way to interface GNU CC to a new language front end is
+with the "tree" data structure.  There is no manual for this data
+structure, but it is described in the files `tree.h' and `tree.def'.

+
+Everything about Instruction Patterns
+=====================================
+
+   Each instruction pattern contains an incomplete RTL expression, with
+pieces to be filled in later, operand constraints that restrict how the
+pieces can be filled in, and an output pattern or C code to generate
+the assembler output, all wrapped up in a `define_insn' expression.
+
+   A `define_insn' is an RTL expression containing four or five
+operands:
+
+  1. An optional name.  The presence of a name indicate that this
+     instruction pattern can perform a certain standard job for the
+     RTL-generation pass of the compiler.  This pass knows certain
+     names and will use the instruction patterns with those names, if
+     the names are defined in the machine description.
+
+     The absence of a name is indicated by writing an empty string
+     where the name should go.  Nameless instruction patterns are never
+     used for generating RTL code, but they may permit several simpler
+     insns to be combined later on.
+
+     Names that are not thus known and used in RTL-generation have no
+     effect; they are equivalent to no name at all.
+
+  2. The "RTL template" (*note RTL Template::.) is a vector of
+     incomplete RTL expressions which show what the instruction should
+     look like.  It is incomplete because it may contain
+     `match_operand', `match_operator', and `match_dup' expressions
+     that stand for operands of the instruction.
+
+     If the vector has only one element, that element is the template
+     for the instruction pattern.  If the vector has multiple elements,
+     then the instruction pattern is a `parallel' expression containing
+     the elements described.
+
+  3. A condition.  This is a string which contains a C expression that
+     is the final test to decide whether an insn body matches this
+     pattern.
+
+     For a named pattern, the condition (if present) may not depend on
+     the data in the insn being matched, but only the
+     target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to test these
+     conditions during initialization in order to learn exactly which
+     named instructions are available in a particular run.
+
+     For nameless patterns, the condition is applied only when matching
+     an individual insn, and only after the insn has matched the
+     pattern's recognition template.  The insn's operands may be found
+     in the vector `operands'.
+
+  4. The "output template": a string that says how to output matching
+     insns as assembler code.  `%' in this string specifies where to
+     substitute the value of an operand.  *Note Output Template::.
+
+     When simple substitution isn't general enough, you can specify a
+     piece of C code to compute the output.  *Note Output Statement::.
+
+  5. Optionally, a vector containing the values of attributes for insns
+     matching this pattern.  *Note Insn Attributes::.

+
+Example of `define_insn'
+========================
+
+   Here is an actual example of an instruction pattern, for the
+68000/68020.
+
+     (define_insn "tstsi"
+       [(set (cc0)
+             (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "rm"))]
+       ""
+       "*
+     { if (TARGET_68020 || ! ADDRESS_REG_P (operands[0]))
+         return \"tstl %0\";
+       return \"cmpl #0,%0\"; }")
+
+   This is an instruction that sets the condition codes based on the
+value of a general operand.  It has no condition, so any insn whose RTL
+description has the form shown may be handled according to this
+pattern.  The name `tstsi' means "test a `SImode' value" and tells the
+RTL generation pass that, when it is necessary to test such a value, an
+insn to do so can be constructed using this pattern.
+
+   The output control string is a piece of C code which chooses which
+output template to return based on the kind of operand and the specific
+type of CPU for which code is being generated.
+
+   `"rm"' is an operand constraint.  Its meaning is explained below.
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: RTL Template,  Next: Output Template,  Prev: Example,  Up: Machine Desc
+
+RTL Template
+============
+
+   The RTL template is used to define which insns match the particular
+pattern and how to find their operands.  For named patterns, the RTL
+template also says how to construct an insn from specified operands.
+
+   Construction involves substituting specified operands into a copy of
+the template.  Matching involves determining the values that serve as
+the operands in the insn being matched.  Both of these activities are
+controlled by special expression types that direct matching and
+substitution of the operands.
+
+`(match_operand:M N PREDICATE CONSTRAINT)'
+     This expression is a placeholder for operand number N of the insn.
+     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted
+     at this point.  When matching an insn, whatever appears at this
+     position in the insn will be taken as operand number N; but it
+     must satisfy PREDICATE or this instruction pattern will not match
+     at all.
+
+     Operand numbers must be chosen consecutively counting from zero in
+     each instruction pattern.  There may be only one `match_operand'
+     expression in the pattern for each operand number.  Usually
+     operands are numbered in the order of appearance in `match_operand'
+     expressions.  In the case of a `define_expand', any operand numbers
+     used only in `match_dup' expressions have higher values than all
+     other operand numbers.
+
+     PREDICATE is a string that is the name of a C function that
+     accepts two arguments, an expression and a machine mode.  During
+     matching, the function will be called with the putative operand as
+     the expression and M as the mode argument (if M is not specified,
+     `VOIDmode' will be used, which normally causes PREDICATE to accept
+     any mode).  If it returns zero, this instruction pattern fails to
+     match.  PREDICATE may be an empty string; then it means no test is
+     to be done on the operand, so anything which occurs in this
+     position is valid.
+
+     Most of the time, PREDICATE will reject modes other than M--but
+     not always.  For example, the predicate `address_operand' uses M
+     as the mode of memory ref that the address should be valid for.
+     Many predicates accept `const_int' nodes even though their mode is
+     `VOIDmode'.
+
+     CONSTRAINT controls reloading and the choice of the best register
+     class to use for a value, as explained later (*note
+     Constraints::.).
+
+     People are often unclear on the difference between the constraint
+     and the predicate.  The predicate helps decide whether a given
+     insn matches the pattern.  The constraint plays no role in this
+     decision; instead, it controls various decisions in the case of an
+     insn which does match.
+
+     On CISC machines, the most common PREDICATE is
+     `"general_operand"'.  This function checks that the putative
+     operand is either a constant, a register or a memory reference,
+     and that it is valid for mode M.
+
+     For an operand that must be a register, PREDICATE should be
+     `"register_operand"'.  Using `"general_operand"' would be valid,
+     since the reload pass would copy any non-register operands through
+     registers, but this would make GNU CC do extra work, it would
+     prevent invariant operands (such as constant) from being removed
+     from loops, and it would prevent the register allocator from doing
+     the best possible job.  On RISC machines, it is usually most
+     efficient to allow PREDICATE to accept only objects that the
+     constraints allow.
+
+     For an operand that must be a constant, you must be sure to either
+     use `"immediate_operand"' for PREDICATE, or make the instruction
+     pattern's extra condition require a constant, or both.  You cannot
+     expect the constraints to do this work!  If the constraints allow
+     only constants, but the predicate allows something else, the
+     compiler will crash when that case arises.
+
+`(match_scratch:M N CONSTRAINT)'
+     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N and
+     indicates that operand must be a `scratch' or `reg' expression.
+
+     When matching patterns, this is equivalent to
+
+          (match_operand:M N "scratch_operand" PRED)
+
+     but, when generating RTL, it produces a (`scratch':M) expression.
+
+     If the last few expressions in a `parallel' are `clobber'
+     expressions whose operands are either a hard register or
+     `match_scratch', the combiner can add or delete them when
+     necessary.  *Note Side Effects::.
+
+`(match_dup N)'
+     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N.  It is
+     used when the operand needs to appear more than once in the insn.
+
+     In construction, `match_dup' acts just like `match_operand': the
+     operand is substituted into the insn being constructed.  But in
+     matching, `match_dup' behaves differently.  It assumes that operand
+     number N has already been determined by a `match_operand'
+     appearing earlier in the recognition template, and it matches only
+     an identical-looking expression.
+
+`(match_operator:M N PREDICATE [OPERANDS...])'
+     This pattern is a kind of placeholder for a variable RTL expression
+     code.
+
+     When constructing an insn, it stands for an RTL expression whose
+     expression code is taken from that of operand N, and whose
+     operands are constructed from the patterns OPERANDS.
+
+     When matching an expression, it matches an expression if the
+     function PREDICATE returns nonzero on that expression *and* the
+     patterns OPERANDS match the operands of the expression.
+
+     Suppose that the function `commutative_operator' is defined as
+     follows, to match any expression whose operator is one of the
+     commutative arithmetic operators of RTL and whose mode is MODE:
+
+          int
+          commutative_operator (x, mode)
+               rtx x;
+               enum machine_mode mode;
+          {
+            enum rtx_code code = GET_CODE (x);
+            if (GET_MODE (x) != mode)
+              return 0;
+            return (GET_RTX_CLASS (code) == 'c'
+                    || code == EQ || code == NE);
+          }
+
+     Then the following pattern will match any RTL expression consisting
+     of a commutative operator applied to two general operands:
+
+          (match_operator:SI 3 "commutative_operator"
+            [(match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "g")
+             (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g")])
+
+     Here the vector `[OPERANDS...]' contains two patterns because the
+     expressions to be matched all contain two operands.
+
+     When this pattern does match, the two operands of the commutative
+     operator are recorded as operands 1 and 2 of the insn.  (This is
+     done by the two instances of `match_operand'.)  Operand 3 of the
+     insn will be the entire commutative expression: use `GET_CODE
+     (operands[3])' to see which commutative operator was used.
+
+     The machine mode M of `match_operator' works like that of
+     `match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
+     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
+     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.
+
+     When constructing an insn, argument 3 of the gen-function will
+     specify the operation (i.e. the expression code) for the
+     expression to be made.  It should be an RTL expression, whose
+     expression code is copied into a new expression whose operands are
+     arguments 1 and 2 of the gen-function.  The subexpressions of
+     argument 3 are not used; only its expression code matters.
+
+     When `match_operator' is used in a pattern for matching an insn,
+     it usually best if the operand number of the `match_operator' is
+     higher than that of the actual operands of the insn.  This improves
+     register allocation because the register allocator often looks at
+     operands 1 and 2 of insns to see if it can do register tying.
+
+     There is no way to specify constraints in `match_operator'.  The
+     operand of the insn which corresponds to the `match_operator'
+     never has any constraints because it is never reloaded as a whole.
+     However, if parts of its OPERANDS are matched by `match_operand'
+     patterns, those parts may have constraints of their own.
+
+`(match_op_dup:M N[OPERANDS...])'
+     Like `match_dup', except that it applies to operators instead of
+     operands.  When constructing an insn, operand number N will be
+     substituted at this point.  But in matching, `match_op_dup' behaves
+     differently.  It assumes that operand number N has already been
+     determined by a `match_operator' appearing earlier in the
+     recognition template, and it matches only an identical-looking
+     expression.
+
+`(match_parallel N PREDICATE [SUBPAT...])'
+     This pattern is a placeholder for an insn that consists of a
+     `parallel' expression with a variable number of elements.  This
+     expression should only appear at the top level of an insn pattern.
+
+     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted at
+     this point.  When matching an insn, it matches if the body of the
+     insn is a `parallel' expression with at least as many elements as
+     the vector of SUBPAT expressions in the `match_parallel', if each
+     SUBPAT matches the corresponding element of the `parallel', *and*
+     the function PREDICATE returns nonzero on the `parallel' that is
+     the body of the insn.  It is the responsibility of the predicate
+     to validate elements of the `parallel' beyond those listed in the
+     `match_parallel'.
+
+     A typical use of `match_parallel' is to match load and store
+     multiple expressions, which can contain a variable number of
+     elements in a `parallel'.  For example,
+
+          (define_insn ""
+            [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
+               [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
+                     (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
+                (use (reg:SI 179))
+                (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
+            ""
+            "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")
+
+     This example comes from `a29k.md'.  The function
+     `load_multiple_operations' is defined in `a29k.c' and checks that
+     subsequent elements in the `parallel' are the same as the `set' in
+     the pattern, except that they are referencing subsequent registers
+     and memory locations.
+
+     An insn that matches this pattern might look like:
+
+          (parallel
+           [(set (reg:SI 20) (mem:SI (reg:SI 100)))
+            (use (reg:SI 179))
+            (clobber (reg:SI 179))
+            (set (reg:SI 21)
+                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
+                                  (const_int 4))))
+            (set (reg:SI 22)
+                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
+                                  (const_int 8))))])
+
+`(match_par_dup N [SUBPAT...])'
+     Like `match_op_dup', but for `match_parallel' instead of
+     `match_operator'.
+
+`(match_insn PREDICATE)'
+     Match a complete insn.  Unlike the other `match_*' recognizers,
+     `match_insn' does not take an operand number.
+
+     The machine mode M of `match_insn' works like that of
+     `match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
+     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
+     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.
+
+`(match_insn2 N PREDICATE)'
+     Match a complete insn.
+
+     The machine mode M of `match_insn2' works like that of
+     `match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
+     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
+     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.
+
+`(address (match_operand:M N "address_operand" ""))'
+     This complex of expressions is a placeholder for an operand number
+     N in a "load address" instruction: an operand which specifies a
+     memory location in the usual way, but for which the actual operand
+     value used is the address of the location, not the contents of the
+     location.
+
+     `address' expressions never appear in RTL code, only in machine
+     descriptions.  And they are used only in machine descriptions that
+     do not use the operand constraint feature.  When operand
+     constraints are in use, the letter `p' in the constraint serves
+     this purpose.
+
+     M is the machine mode of the *memory location being addressed*,
+     not the machine mode of the address itself.  That mode is always
+     the same on a given target machine (it is `Pmode', which normally
+     is `SImode'), so there is no point in mentioning it; thus, no
+     machine mode is written in the `address' expression.  If some day
+     support is added for machines in which addresses of different
+     kinds of objects appear differently or are used differently (such
+     as the PDP-10), different formats would perhaps need different
+     machine modes and these modes might be written in the `address'
+     expression.

+
+Output Templates and Operand Substitution
+=========================================
+
+   The "output template" is a string which specifies how to output the
+assembler code for an instruction pattern.  Most of the template is a
+fixed string which is output literally.  The character `%' is used to
+specify where to substitute an operand; it can also be used to identify
+places where different variants of the assembler require different
+syntax.
+
+   In the simplest case, a `%' followed by a digit N says to output
+operand N at that point in the string.
+
+   `%' followed by a letter and a digit says to output an operand in an
+alternate fashion.  Four letters have standard, built-in meanings
+described below.  The machine description macro `PRINT_OPERAND' can
+define additional letters with nonstandard meanings.
+
+   `%cDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand that is a constant
+value without the syntax that normally indicates an immediate operand.
+
+   `%nDIGIT' is like `%cDIGIT' except that the value of the constant is
+negated before printing.
+
+   `%aDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand as if it were a
+memory reference, with the actual operand treated as the address.  This
+may be useful when outputting a "load address" instruction, because
+often the assembler syntax for such an instruction requires you to
+write the operand as if it were a memory reference.
+
+   `%lDIGIT' is used to substitute a `label_ref' into a jump
+instruction.
+
+   `%=' outputs a number which is unique to each instruction in the
+entire compilation.  This is useful for making local labels to be
+referred to more than once in a single template that generates multiple
+assembler instructions.
+
+   `%' followed by a punctuation character specifies a substitution that
+does not use an operand.  Only one case is standard: `%%' outputs a `%'
+into the assembler code.  Other nonstandard cases can be defined in the
+`PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  You must also define which punctuation
+characters are valid with the `PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' macro.
+
+   The template may generate multiple assembler instructions.  Write
+the text for the instructions, with `\;' between them.
+
+   When the RTL contains two operands which are required by constraint
+to match each other, the output template must refer only to the
+lower-numbered operand.  Matching operands are not always identical,
+and the rest of the compiler arranges to put the proper RTL expression
+for printing into the lower-numbered operand.
+
+   One use of nonstandard letters or punctuation following `%' is to
+distinguish between different assembler languages for the same machine;
+for example, Motorola syntax versus MIT syntax for the 68000.  Motorola
+syntax requires periods in most opcode names, while MIT syntax does
+not.  For example, the opcode `movel' in MIT syntax is `move.l' in
+Motorola syntax.  The same file of patterns is used for both kinds of
+output syntax, but the character sequence `%.' is used in each place
+where Motorola syntax wants a period.  The `PRINT_OPERAND' macro for
+Motorola syntax defines the sequence to output a period; the macro for
+MIT syntax defines it to do nothing.
+
+   As a special case, a template consisting of the single character `#'
+instructs the compiler to first split the insn, and then output the
+resulting instructions separately.  This helps eliminate redundancy in
+the output templates.   If you have a `define_insn' that needs to emit
+multiple assembler instructions, and there is an matching `define_split'
+already defined, then you can simply use `#' as the output template
+instead of writing an output template that emits the multiple assembler
+instructions.
+

+C Statements for Assembler Output
+=================================
+
+   Often a single fixed template string cannot produce correct and
+efficient assembler code for all the cases that are recognized by a
+single instruction pattern.  For example, the opcodes may depend on the
+kinds of operands; or some unfortunate combinations of operands may
+require extra machine instructions.
+
+   If the output control string starts with a `@', then it is actually
+a series of templates, each on a separate line.  (Blank lines and
+leading spaces and tabs are ignored.)  The templates correspond to the
+pattern's constraint alternatives (*note Multi-Alternative::.).  For
+example, if a target machine has a two-address add instruction `addr'
+to add into a register and another `addm' to add a register to memory,
+you might write this pattern:
+
+     (define_insn "addsi3"
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
+             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0,0")
+                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g,r")))]
+       ""
+       "@
+        addr %2,%0
+        addm %2,%0")
+
+   If the output control string starts with a `*', then it is not an
+output template but rather a piece of C program that should compute a
+template.  It should execute a `return' statement to return the
+template-string you want.  Most such templates use C string literals,
+which require doublequote characters to delimit them.  To include these
+doublequote characters in the string, prefix each one with `\'.
+
+   The operands may be found in the array `operands', whose C data type
+is `rtx []'.
+
+   It is very common to select different ways of generating assembler
+code based on whether an immediate operand is within a certain range.
+Be careful when doing this, because the result of `INTVAL' is an
+integer on the host machine.  If the host machine has more bits in an
+`int' than the target machine has in the mode in which the constant
+will be used, then some of the bits you get from `INTVAL' will be
+superfluous.  For proper results, you must carefully disregard the
+values of those bits.
+
+   It is possible to output an assembler instruction and then go on to
+output or compute more of them, using the subroutine `output_asm_insn'.
+This receives two arguments: a template-string and a vector of
+operands.  The vector may be `operands', or it may be another array of
+`rtx' that you declare locally and initialize yourself.
+
+   When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
+often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by
+which alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code can test
+the variable `which_alternative', which is the ordinal number of the
+alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for the first, 1 for the
+second alternative, etc.).
+
+   For example, suppose there are two opcodes for storing zero, `clrreg'
+for registers and `clrmem' for memory locations.  Here is how a pattern
+could use `which_alternative' to choose between them:
+
+     (define_insn ""
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
+             (const_int 0))]
+       ""
+       "*
+       return (which_alternative == 0
+               ? \"clrreg %0\" : \"clrmem %0\");
+       ")
+
+   The example above, where the assembler code to generate was *solely*
+determined by the alternative, could also have been specified as
+follows, having the output control string start with a `@':
+
+     (define_insn ""
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
+             (const_int 0))]
+       ""
+       "@
+        clrreg %0
+        clrmem %0")

+
+Operand Constraints
+===================
+
+   Each `match_operand' in an instruction pattern can specify a
+constraint for the type of operands allowed.  Constraints can say
+whether an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register;
+whether the operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of
+address; whether the operand may be an immediate constant, and which
+possible values it may have.  Constraints can also require two operands
+to match.

+
+Simple Constraints
+------------------
+
+   The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
+which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are the
+letters that are allowed:
+
+`m'
+     A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the
+     machine supports in general.
+
+`o'
+     A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
+     "offsettable".  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
+     the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine
+     mode) may be added to the address and the result is also a valid
+     memory address.
+
+     For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
+     address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
+     slightly larger constant is also within the range of
+     address-offsets supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or
+     autodecrement address is not offsettable.  More complicated
+     indirect/indexed addresses may or may not be offsettable depending
+     on the other addressing modes that the machine supports.
+
+     Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
+     operand, the constraint letter `o' is valid only when accompanied
+     by both `<' (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
+     and `>' (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).
+
+`V'
+     A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words,
+     anything that would fit the `m' constraint but not the `o'
+     constraint.
+
+`<'
+     A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either
+     predecrement or postdecrement) is allowed.
+
+`>'
+     A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either
+     preincrement or postincrement) is allowed.
+
+`r'
+     A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
+     register.
+
+`d', `a', `f', ...
+     Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand
+     for particular classes of registers.  `d', `a' and `f' are defined
+     on the 68000/68020 to stand for data, address and floating point
+     registers.
+
+`i'
+     An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
+     This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
+     assembly time.
+
+`n'
+     An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
+     Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands
+     less than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use
+     `n' rather than `i'.
+
+`I', `J', `K', ... `P'
+     Other letters in the range `I' through `P' may be defined in a
+     machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
+     explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
+     68000, `I' is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
+     This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
+     instructions.
+
+`E'
+     An immediate floating operand (expression code `const_double') is
+     allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same
+     as that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).
+
+`F'
+     An immediate floating operand (expression code `const_double') is
+     allowed.
+
+`G', `H'
+     `G' and `H' may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to
+     permit immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.
+
+`s'
+     An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit
+     integer is allowed.
+
+     This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand
+     with a value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow
+     any known value.  So why use `s' instead of `i'?  Sometimes it
+     allows better code to be generated.
+
+     For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible
+     to use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between
+     -128 and 127, better code results from loading the value into a
+     register and using the register.  This is because the load into
+     the register can be done with a `moveq' instruction.  We arrange
+     for this to happen by defining the letter `K' to mean "any integer
+     outside the range -128 to 127", and then specifying `Ks' in the
+     operand constraints.
+
+`g'
+     Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed,
+     except for registers that are not general registers.
+
+`X'
+     Any operand whatsoever is allowed, even if it does not satisfy
+     `general_operand'.  This is normally used in the constraint of a
+     `match_scratch' when certain alternatives will not actually
+     require a scratch register.
+
+`0', `1', `2', ... `9'
+     An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.
+     If a digit is used together with letters within the same
+     alternative, the digit should come last.
+
+     This is called a "matching constraint" and what it really means is
+     that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
+     considered separate in the RTL insn.  For example, an add insn has
+     two input operands and one output operand in the RTL, but on most
+     CISC machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one
+     of them an input-output operand:
+
+          addl #35,r12
+
+     Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.  More
+     precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
+     operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
+     smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
+     constraint.
+
+     For operands to match in a particular case usually means that they
+     are identical-looking RTL expressions.  But in a few special cases
+     specific kinds of dissimilarity are allowed.  For example, `*x' as
+     an input operand will match `*x++' as an output operand.  For
+     proper results in such cases, the output template should always
+     use the output-operand's number when printing the operand.
+
+`p'
+     An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is for
+     "load address" and "push address" instructions.
+
+     `p' in the constraint must be accompanied by `address_operand' as
+     the predicate in the `match_operand'.  This predicate interprets
+     the mode specified in the `match_operand' as the mode of the memory
+     reference for which the address would be valid.
+
+`Q', `R', `S', ... `U'
+     Letters in the range `Q' through `U' may be defined in a
+     machine-dependent fashion to stand for arbitrary operand types.
+     The machine description macro `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' is passed the
+     operand as its first argument and the constraint letter as its
+     second operand.
+
+     A typical use for this would be to distinguish certain types of
+     memory references that affect other insn operands.
+
+     Do not define these constraint letters to accept register
+     references (`reg'); the reload pass does not expect this and would
+     not handle it properly.
+
+   In order to have valid assembler code, each operand must satisfy its
+constraint.  But a failure to do so does not prevent the pattern from
+applying to an insn.  Instead, it directs the compiler to modify the
+code so that the constraint will be satisfied.  Usually this is done by
+copying an operand into a register.
+
+   Contrast, therefore, the two instruction patterns that follow:
+
+     (define_insn ""
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
+             (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
+                      (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r")))]
+       ""
+       "...")
+
+which has two operands, one of which must appear in two places, and
+
+     (define_insn ""
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
+             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
+                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "r")))]
+       ""
+       "...")
+
+which has three operands, two of which are required by a constraint to
+be identical.  If we are considering an insn of the form
+
+     (insn N PREV NEXT
+       (set (reg:SI 3)
+            (plus:SI (reg:SI 6) (reg:SI 109)))
+       ...)
+
+the first pattern would not apply at all, because this insn does not
+contain two identical subexpressions in the right place.  The pattern
+would say, "That does not look like an add instruction; try other
+patterns."  The second pattern would say, "Yes, that's an add
+instruction, but there is something wrong with it."  It would direct
+the reload pass of the compiler to generate additional insns to make
+the constraint true.  The results might look like this:
+
+     (insn N2 PREV N
+       (set (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 6))
+       ...)
+     
+     (insn N N2 NEXT
+       (set (reg:SI 3)
+            (plus:SI (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 109)))
+       ...)
+
+   It is up to you to make sure that each operand, in each pattern, has
+constraints that can handle any RTL expression that could be present for
+that operand.  (When multiple alternatives are in use, each pattern
+must, for each possible combination of operand expressions, have at
+least one alternative which can handle that combination of operands.)
+The constraints don't need to *allow* any possible operand--when this is
+the case, they do not constrain--but they must at least point the way to
+reloading any possible operand so that it will fit.
+
+   * If the constraint accepts whatever operands the predicate permits,
+     there is no problem: reloading is never necessary for this operand.
+
+     For example, an operand whose constraints permit everything except
+     registers is safe provided its predicate rejects registers.
+
+     An operand whose predicate accepts only constant values is safe
+     provided its constraints include the letter `i'.  If any possible
+     constant value is accepted, then nothing less than `i' will do; if
+     the predicate is more selective, then the constraints may also be
+     more selective.
+
+   * Any operand expression can be reloaded by copying it into a
+     register.  So if an operand's constraints allow some kind of
+     register, it is certain to be safe.  It need not permit all
+     classes of registers; the compiler knows how to copy a register
+     into another register of the proper class in order to make an
+     instruction valid.
+
+   * A nonoffsettable memory reference can be reloaded by copying the
+     address into a register.  So if the constraint uses the letter
+     `o', all memory references are taken care of.
+
+   * A constant operand can be reloaded by allocating space in memory to
+     hold it as preinitialized data.  Then the memory reference can be
+     used in place of the constant.  So if the constraint uses the
+     letters `o' or `m', constant operands are not a problem.
+
+   * If the constraint permits a constant and a pseudo register used in
+     an insn was not allocated to a hard register and is equivalent to
+     a constant, the register will be replaced with the constant.  If
+     the predicate does not permit a constant and the insn is
+     re-recognized for some reason, the compiler will crash.  Thus the
+     predicate must always recognize any objects allowed by the
+     constraint.
+
+   If the operand's predicate can recognize registers, but the
+constraint does not permit them, it can make the compiler crash.  When
+this operand happens to be a register, the reload pass will be stymied,
+because it does not know how to copy a register temporarily into memory.
+
+   If the predicate accepts a unary operator, the constraint applies to
+the operand.  For example, the MIPS processor at ISA level 3 supports an
+instruction which adds two registers in `SImode' to produce a `DImode'
+result, but only if the registers are correctly sign extended.  This
+predicate for the input operands accepts a `sign_extend' of an `SImode'
+register.  Write the constraint to indicate the type of register that
+is required for the operand of the `sign_extend'.

+
+Multiple Alternative Constraints
+--------------------------------
+
+   Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of
+possible operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction
+can combine register or an immediate value into memory, or it can
+combine any kind of operand into a register; but it cannot combine one
+memory location into another.
+
+   These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An
+alternative can be described by a series of letters for each operand.
+The overall constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this
+operand from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this
+operand from the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last
+alternative.  Here is how it is done for fullword logical-or on the
+68000:
+
+     (define_insn "iorsi3"
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=m,d")
+             (ior:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
+                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dKs,dmKs")))]
+       ...)
+
+   The first alternative has `m' (memory) for operand 0, `0' for
+operand 1 (meaning it must match operand 0), and `dKs' for operand 2.
+The second alternative has `d' (data register) for operand 0, `0' for
+operand 1, and `dmKs' for operand 2.  The `=' and `%' in the
+constraints apply to all the alternatives; their meaning is explained
+in the next section (*note Class Preferences::.).
+
+   If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is
+valid.  Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many
+instructions must be added to copy the operands so that that
+alternative applies.  The alternative requiring the least copying is
+chosen.  If two alternatives need the same amount of copying, the one
+that comes first is chosen.  These choices can be altered with the `?'
+and `!' characters:
+
+`?'
+     Disparage slightly the alternative that the `?' appears in, as a
+     choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
+     this alternative as one unit more costly for each `?' that appears
+     in it.
+
+`!'
+     Disparage severely the alternative that the `!' appears in.  This
+     alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading, but if
+     reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.
+
+   When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
+often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
+alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code for writing the
+assembler code can use the variable `which_alternative', which is the
+ordinal number of the alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for
+the first, 1 for the second alternative, etc.).  *Note Output
+Statement::.

+
+Register Class Preferences
+--------------------------
+
+   The operand constraints have another function: they enable the
+compiler to decide which kind of hardware register a pseudo register is
+best allocated to.  The compiler examines the constraints that apply to
+the insns that use the pseudo register, looking for the
+machine-dependent letters such as `d' and `a' that specify classes of
+registers.  The pseudo register is put in whichever class gets the most
+"votes".  The constraint letters `g' and `r' also vote: they vote in
+favor of a general register.  The machine description says which
+registers are considered general.
+
+   Of course, on some machines all registers are equivalent, and no
+register classes are defined.  Then none of this complexity is relevant.

+
+Constraint Modifier Characters
+------------------------------
+
+   Here are constraint modifier characters.
+
+`='
+     Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the
+     previous value is discarded and replaced by output data.
+
+`+'
+     Means that this operand is both read and written by the
+     instruction.
+
+     When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
+     it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
+     which are outputs from it.  `=' identifies an output; `+'
+     identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other
+     operands are assumed to be input only.
+
+`&'
+     Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
+     "earlyclobber" operand, which is modified before the instruction is
+     finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may
+     not lie in a register that is used as an input operand or as part
+     of any memory address.
+
+     `&' applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
+     constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
+     requires `&' while others do not.  See, for example, the `movdf'
+     insn of the 68000.
+
+     An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only
+     use as an input occurs before the early result is written.  Adding
+     alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce better code
+     when only some of the inputs can be affected by the earlyclobber.
+     See, for example, the `mulsi3' insn of the ARM.
+
+     `&' does not obviate the need to write `='.
+
+`%'
+     Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
+     following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange
+     the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands
+     fit the constraints.  This is often used in patterns for addition
+     instructions that really have only two operands: the result must
+     go in one of the arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000
+     halfword-add instruction is defined:
+
+          (define_insn "addhi3"
+            [(set (match_operand:HI 0 "general_operand" "=m,r")
+               (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
+                        (match_operand:HI 2 "general_operand" "di,g")))]
+            ...)
+
+`#'
+     Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
+     ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
+     register preferences.
+
+`*'
+     Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
+     register preferences.  `*' has no effect on the meaning of the
+     constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.
+
+     Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
+     halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
+     copying it into an address register.  While either kind of
+     register is acceptable, the constraints on an address-register
+     destination are less strict, so it is best if register allocation
+     makes an address register its goal.  Therefore, `*' is used so
+     that the `d' constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when
+     computing register preferences.
+
+          (define_insn "extendhisi2"
+            [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=*d,a")
+                  (sign_extend:SI
+                   (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "0,g")))]
+            ...)

+Constraints for Particular Machines
+-----------------------------------
+
+   Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint
+letters in `asm' arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily
+to people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
+that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
+commonly used constraints are `m' and `r' (for memory and
+general-purpose registers respectively; *note Simple Constraints::.),
+and `I', usually the letter indicating the most common
+immediate-constant format.
+
+   For each machine architecture, the `config/MACHINE.h' file defines
+additional constraints.  These constraints are used by the compiler
+itself for instruction generation, as well as for `asm' statements;
+therefore, some of the constraints are not particularly interesting for
+`asm'.  The constraints are defined through these macros:
+
+`REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER'
+     Register class constraints (usually lower case).
+
+`CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P'
+     Immediate constant constraints, for non-floating point constants of
+     word size or smaller precision (usually upper case).
+
+`CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P'
+     Immediate constant constraints, for all floating point constants
+     and for constants of greater than word size precision (usually
+     upper case).
+
+`EXTRA_CONSTRAINT'
+     Special cases of registers or memory.  This macro is not required,
+     and is only defined for some machines.
+
+   Inspecting these macro definitions in the compiler source for your
+machine is the best way to be certain you have the right constraints.
+However, here is a summary of the machine-dependent constraints
+available on some particular machines.

+
+Not Using Constraints
+---------------------
+
+   Some machines are so clean that operand constraints are not
+required.  For example, on the Vax, an operand valid in one context is
+valid in any other context.  On such a machine, every operand
+constraint would be `g', excepting only operands of "load address"
+instructions which are written as if they referred to a memory
+location's contents but actual refer to its address.  They would have
+constraint `p'.
+
+   For such machines, instead of writing `g' and `p' for all the
+constraints, you can choose to write a description with empty
+constraints.  Then you write `""' for the constraint in every
+`match_operand'.  Address operands are identified by writing an
+`address' expression around the `match_operand', not by their
+constraints.
+
+   When the machine description has just empty constraints, certain
+parts of compilation are skipped, making the compiler faster.  However,
+few machines actually do not need constraints; all machine descriptions
+now in existence use constraints.
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Standard Names,  Next: Pattern Ordering,  Prev: Constraints,  Up: Machine Desc
+
+Standard Pattern Names For Generation
+=====================================
+
+   Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the
+RTL generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
+instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
+pattern to accomplish a certain task.
+
+`movM'
+     Here M stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lower case.
+     This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from
+     operand 1 to operand 0.  For example, `movsi' moves full-word data.
+
+     If operand 0 is a `subreg' with mode M of a register whose own
+     mode is wider than M, the effect of this instruction is to store
+     the specified value in the part of the register that corresponds
+     to mode M.  The effect on the rest of the register is undefined.
+
+     This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all,
+     each of these names *must* be defined, because there is no other
+     way to copy a datum from one place to another.
+
+     Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation
+     pass.  Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values
+     from stack slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one
+     of the operands is a hard register and the other is an operand
+     that can need to be reloaded into a register.
+
+     Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must
+     generate RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary
+     registers--no registers other than the operands.  For example, if
+     you support the pattern with a `define_expand', then in such a
+     case the `define_expand' mustn't call `force_reg' or any other such
+     function which might generate new pseudo registers.
+
+     This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine
+     where fetching those modes from memory normally requires several
+     insns and some temporary registers.  Look in `spur.md' to see how
+     the requirement can be satisfied.
+
+     During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be
+     passed as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a
+     valid address later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may
+     be done with the address except to use it as it stands.  If it is
+     copied, it will not be replaced with a valid address.  No attempt
+     should be made to make such an address into a valid address and no
+     routine (such as `change_address') that will do so may be called.
+     Note that `general_operand' will fail when applied to such an
+     address.
+
+     The global variable `reload_in_progress' (which must be explicitly
+     declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
+     handling is required.
+
+     The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of
+     the machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can
+     only be pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on
+     other machines explicit memory references will get optional
+     reloads.
+
+     If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from
+     memory, it can be allocated using `gen_reg_rtx' prior to life
+     analysis.
+
+     If there are cases needing scratch registers after reload, you
+     must define `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' and perhaps also
+     `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to detect them, and provide
+     patterns `reload_inM' or `reload_outM' to handle them.  *Note
+     Register Classes::.
+
+     The global variable `no_new_pseudos' can be used to determine if it
+     is unsafe to create new pseudo registers.  If this variable is
+     nonzero, then it is unsafe to call `gen_reg_rtx' to allocate a new
+     pseudo.
+
+     The constraints on a `movM' must permit moving any hard register
+     to any other hard register provided that `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
+     permits mode M in both registers and `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied
+     to their classes returns a value of 2.
+
+     It is obligatory to support floating point `movM' instructions
+     into and out of any registers that can hold fixed point values,
+     because unions and structures (which have modes `SImode' or
+     `DImode') can be in those registers and they may have floating
+     point members.
+
+     There may also be a need to support fixed point `movM'
+     instructions in and out of floating point registers.
+     Unfortunately, I have forgotten why this was so, and I don't know
+     whether it is still true.  If `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' rejects fixed
+     point values in floating point registers, then the constraints of
+     the fixed point `movM' instructions must be designed to avoid ever
+     trying to reload into a floating point register.
+
+`reload_inM'
+`reload_outM'
+     Like `movM', but used when a scratch register is required to move
+     between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch
+     register.  See the discussion of the `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS'
+     macro in *note Register Classes::..
+
+`movstrictM'
+     Like `movM' except that if operand 0 is a `subreg' with mode M of
+     a register whose natural mode is wider, the `movstrictM'
+     instruction is guaranteed not to alter any of the register except
+     the part which belongs to mode M.
+
+`load_multiple'
+     Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive
+     registers.  Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers,
+     operand 1 is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a
+     constant: the number of consecutive registers.
+
+     Define this only if the target machine really has such an
+     instruction; do not define this if the most efficient way of
+     loading consecutive registers from memory is to do them one at a
+     time.
+
+     On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
+     registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
+     ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
+     machines, use a `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.)
+     and make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.
+
+     Write the generated insn as a `parallel' with elements being a
+     `set' of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
+     also need `use' or `clobber' elements).  Use a `match_parallel'
+     (*note RTL Template::.) to recognize the insn.  See `a29k.md' and
+     `rs6000.md' for examples of the use of this insn pattern.
+
+`store_multiple'
+     Similar to `load_multiple', but store several consecutive registers
+     into consecutive memory locations.  Operand 0 is the first of the
+     consecutive memory locations, operand 1 is the first register, and
+     operand 2 is a constant: the number of consecutive registers.
+
+`addM3'
+     Add operand 2 and operand 1, storing the result in operand 0.  All
+     operands must have mode M.  This can be used even on two-address
+     machines, by means of constraints requiring operands 1 and 0 to be
+     the same location.
+
+`subM3', `mulM3'
+`divM3', `udivM3', `modM3', `umodM3'
+`sminM3', `smaxM3', `uminM3', `umaxM3'
+`andM3', `iorM3', `xorM3'
+     Similar, for other arithmetic operations.
+
+`mulhisi3'
+     Multiply operands 1 and 2, which have mode `HImode', and store a
+     `SImode' product in operand 0.
+
+`mulqihi3', `mulsidi3'
+     Similar widening-multiplication instructions of other widths.
+
+`umulqihi3', `umulhisi3', `umulsidi3'
+     Similar widening-multiplication instructions that do unsigned
+     multiplication.
+
+`mulM3_highpart'
+     Perform a signed multiplication of operands 1 and 2, which have
+     mode M, and store the most significant half of the product in
+     operand 0.  The least significant half of the product is discarded.
+
+`umulM3_highpart'
+     Similar, but the multiplication is unsigned.
+
+`divmodM4'
+     Signed division that produces both a quotient and a remainder.
+     Operand 1 is divided by operand 2 to produce a quotient stored in
+     operand 0 and a remainder stored in operand 3.
+
+     For machines with an instruction that produces both a quotient and
+     a remainder, provide a pattern for `divmodM4' but do not provide
+     patterns for `divM3' and `modM3'.  This allows optimization in the
+     relatively common case when both the quotient and remainder are
+     computed.
+
+     If an instruction that just produces a quotient or just a remainder
+     exists and is more efficient than the instruction that produces
+     both, write the output routine of `divmodM4' to call
+     `find_reg_note' and look for a `REG_UNUSED' note on the quotient
+     or remainder and generate the appropriate instruction.
+
+`udivmodM4'
+     Similar, but does unsigned division.
+
+`ashlM3'
+     Arithmetic-shift operand 1 left by a number of bits specified by
+     operand 2, and store the result in operand 0.  Here M is the mode
+     of operand 0 and operand 1; operand 2's mode is specified by the
+     instruction pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to
+     that mode before generating the instruction.
+
+`ashrM3', `lshrM3', `rotlM3', `rotrM3'
+     Other shift and rotate instructions, analogous to the `ashlM3'
+     instructions.
+
+`negM2'
+     Negate operand 1 and store the result in operand 0.
+
+`absM2'
+     Store the absolute value of operand 1 into operand 0.
+
+`sqrtM2'
+     Store the square root of operand 1 into operand 0.
+
+     The `sqrt' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
+     corresponds to the C data type `double'.
+
+`ffsM2'
+     Store into operand 0 one plus the index of the least significant
+     1-bit of operand 1.  If operand 1 is zero, store zero.  M is the
+     mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
+     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
+     before generating the instruction.
+
+     The `ffs' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
+     corresponds to the C data type `int'.
+
+`one_cmplM2'
+     Store the bitwise-complement of operand 1 into operand 0.
+
+`cmpM'
+     Compare operand 0 and operand 1, and set the condition codes.  The
+     RTL pattern should look like this:
+
+          (set (cc0) (compare (match_operand:M 0 ...)
+                              (match_operand:M 1 ...)))
+
+`tstM'
+     Compare operand 0 against zero, and set the condition codes.  The
+     RTL pattern should look like this:
+
+          (set (cc0) (match_operand:M 0 ...))
+
+     `tstM' patterns should not be defined for machines that do not use
+     `(cc0)'.  Doing so would confuse the optimizer since it would no
+     longer be clear which `set' operations were comparisons.  The
+     `cmpM' patterns should be used instead.
+
+`movstrM'
+     Block move instruction.  The addresses of the destination and
+     source strings are the first two operands, and both are in mode
+     `Pmode'.
+
+     The number of bytes to move is the third operand, in mode M.
+     Usually, you specify `word_mode' for M.  However, if you can
+     generate better code knowing the range of valid lengths is smaller
+     than those representable in a full word, you should provide a
+     pattern with a mode corresponding to the range of values you can
+     handle efficiently (e.g., `QImode' for values in the range 0-127;
+     note we avoid numbers that appear negative) and also a pattern
+     with `word_mode'.
+
+     The fourth operand is the known shared alignment of the source and
+     destination, in the form of a `const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the
+     compiler knows that both source and destination are word-aligned,
+     it may provide the value 4 for this operand.
+
+     Descriptions of multiple `movstrM' patterns can only be beneficial
+     if the patterns for smaller modes have fewer restrictions on their
+     first, second and fourth operands.  Note that the mode M in
+     `movstrM' does not impose any restriction on the mode of
+     individually moved data units in the block.
+
+     These patterns need not give special consideration to the
+     possibility that the source and destination strings might overlap.
+
+`clrstrM'
+     Block clear instruction.  The addresses of the destination string
+     is the first operand, in mode `Pmode'.  The number of bytes to
+     clear is the second operand, in mode M.  See `movstrM' for a
+     discussion of the choice of mode.
+
+     The third operand is the known alignment of the destination, in
+     the form of a `const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the compiler knows that
+     the destination is word-aligned, it may provide the value 4 for
+     this operand.
+
+     The use for multiple `clrstrM' is as for `movstrM'.
+
+`cmpstrM'
+     Block compare instruction, with five operands.  Operand 0 is the
+     output; it has mode M.  The remaining four operands are like the
+     operands of `movstrM'.  The two memory blocks specified are
+     compared byte by byte in lexicographic order.  The effect of the
+     instruction is to store a value in operand 0 whose sign indicates
+     the result of the comparison.
+
+`strlenM'
+     Compute the length of a string, with three operands.  Operand 0 is
+     the result (of mode M), operand 1 is a `mem' referring to the
+     first character of the string, operand 2 is the character to
+     search for (normally zero), and operand 3 is a constant describing
+     the known alignment of the beginning of the string.
+
+`floatMN2'
+     Convert signed integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M) to
+     floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).
+
+`floatunsMN2'
+     Convert unsigned integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M)
+     to floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).
+
+`fixMN2'
+     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
+     mode N as a signed number and store in operand 0 (which has mode
+     N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value of
+     operand 1 is an integer.
+
+`fixunsMN2'
+     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
+     mode N as an unsigned number and store in operand 0 (which has
+     mode N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value
+     of operand 1 is an integer.
+
+`ftruncM2'
+     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to an integer
+     value, still represented in floating point mode M, and store it in
+     operand 0 (valid for floating point mode M).
+
+`fix_truncMN2'
+     Like `fixMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M by
+     converting the value to an integer.
+
+`fixuns_truncMN2'
+     Like `fixunsMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M
+     by converting the value to an integer.
+
+`truncMN2'
+     Truncate operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
+     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
+     both floating point.
+
+`extendMN2'
+     Sign-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
+     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
+     both floating point.
+
+`zero_extendMN2'
+     Zero-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
+     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point.
+
+`extv'
+     Extract a bit field from operand 1 (a register or memory operand),
+     where operand 2 specifies the width in bits and operand 3 the
+     starting bit, and store it in operand 0.  Operand 0 must have mode
+     `word_mode'.  Operand 1 may have mode `byte_mode' or `word_mode';
+     often `word_mode' is allowed only for registers.  Operands 2 and 3
+     must be valid for `word_mode'.
+
+     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
+     constants for operands 2 and 3.
+
+     The bit-field value is sign-extended to a full word integer before
+     it is stored in operand 0.
+
+`extzv'
+     Like `extv' except that the bit-field value is zero-extended.
+
+`insv'
+     Store operand 3 (which must be valid for `word_mode') into a bit
+     field in operand 0, where operand 1 specifies the width in bits and
+     operand 2 the starting bit.  Operand 0 may have mode `byte_mode' or
+     `word_mode'; often `word_mode' is allowed only for registers.
+     Operands 1 and 2 must be valid for `word_mode'.
+
+     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
+     constants for operands 1 and 2.
+
+`movMODEcc'
+     Conditionally move operand 2 or operand 3 into operand 0 according
+     to the comparison in operand 1.  If the comparison is true,
+     operand 2 is moved into operand 0, otherwise operand 3 is moved.
+
+     The mode of the operands being compared need not be the same as
+     the operands being moved.  Some machines, sparc64 for example,
+     have instructions that conditionally move an integer value based
+     on the floating point condition codes and vice versa.
+
+     If the machine does not have conditional move instructions, do not
+     define these patterns.
+
+`sCOND'
+     Store zero or nonzero in the operand according to the condition
+     codes.  Value stored is nonzero iff the condition COND is true.
+     COND is the name of a comparison operation expression code, such
+     as `eq', `lt' or `leu'.
+
+     You specify the mode that the operand must have when you write the
+     `match_operand' expression.  The compiler automatically sees which
+     mode you have used and supplies an operand of that mode.
+
+     The value stored for a true condition must have 1 as its low bit,
+     or else must be negative.  Otherwise the instruction is not
+     suitable and you should omit it from the machine description.  You
+     describe to the compiler exactly which value is stored by defining
+     the macro `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::.).  If a description
+     cannot be found that can be used for all the `sCOND' patterns, you
+     should omit those operations from the machine description.
+
+     These operations may fail, but should do so only in relatively
+     uncommon cases; if they would fail for common cases involving
+     integer comparisons, it is best to omit these patterns.
+
+     If these operations are omitted, the compiler will usually
+     generate code that copies the constant one to the target and
+     branches around an assignment of zero to the target.  If this code
+     is more efficient than the potential instructions used for the
+     `sCOND' pattern followed by those required to convert the result
+     into a 1 or a zero in `SImode', you should omit the `sCOND'
+     operations from the machine description.
+
+`bCOND'
+     Conditional branch instruction.  Operand 0 is a `label_ref' that
+     refers to the label to jump to.  Jump if the condition codes meet
+     condition COND.
+
+     Some machines do not follow the model assumed here where a
+     comparison instruction is followed by a conditional branch
+     instruction.  In that case, the `cmpM' (and `tstM') patterns should
+     simply store the operands away and generate all the required insns
+     in a `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.) for the
+     conditional branch operations.  All calls to expand `bCOND'
+     patterns are immediately preceded by calls to expand either a
+     `cmpM' pattern or a `tstM' pattern.
+
+     Machines that use a pseudo register for the condition code value,
+     or where the mode used for the comparison depends on the condition
+     being tested, should also use the above mechanism.  *Note Jump
+     Patterns::.
+
+     The above discussion also applies to the `movMODEcc' and `sCOND'
+     patterns.
+
+`call'
+     Subroutine call instruction returning no value.  Operand 0 is the
+     function to call; operand 1 is the number of bytes of arguments
+     pushed as a `const_int'; operand 2 is the number of registers used
+     as operands.
+
+     On most machines, operand 2 is not actually stored into the RTL
+     pattern.  It is supplied for the sake of some RISC machines which
+     need to put this information into the assembler code; they can put
+     it in the RTL instead of operand 1.
+
+     Operand 0 should be a `mem' RTX whose address is the address of the
+     function.  Note, however, that this address can be a `symbol_ref'
+     expression even if it would not be a legitimate memory address on
+     the target machine.  If it is also not a valid argument for a call
+     instruction, the pattern for this operation should be a
+     `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.) that places the
+     address into a register and uses that register in the call
+     instruction.
+
+`call_value'
+     Subroutine call instruction returning a value.  Operand 0 is the
+     hard register in which the value is returned.  There are three more
+     operands, the same as the three operands of the `call' instruction
+     (but with numbers increased by one).
+
+     Subroutines that return `BLKmode' objects use the `call' insn.
+
+`call_pop', `call_value_pop'
+     Similar to `call' and `call_value', except used if defined and if
+     `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' is non-zero.  They should emit a `parallel'
+     that contains both the function call and a `set' to indicate the
+     adjustment made to the frame pointer.
+
+     For machines where `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' can be non-zero, the use of
+     these patterns increases the number of functions for which the
+     frame pointer can be eliminated, if desired.
+
+`untyped_call'
+     Subroutine call instruction returning a value of any type.
+     Operand 0 is the function to call; operand 1 is a memory location
+     where the result of calling the function is to be stored; operand
+     2 is a `parallel' expression where each element is a `set'
+     expression that indicates the saving of a function return value
+     into the result block.
+
+     This instruction pattern should be defined to support
+     `__builtin_apply' on machines where special instructions are needed
+     to call a subroutine with arbitrary arguments or to save the value
+     returned.  This instruction pattern is required on machines that
+     have multiple registers that can hold a return value (i.e.
+     `FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' is true for more than one register).
+
+`return'
+     Subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern name
+     should be defined only if a single instruction can do all the work
+     of returning from a function.
+
+     Like the `movM' patterns, this pattern is also used after the RTL
+     generation phase.  In this case it is to support machines where
+     multiple instructions are usually needed to return from a
+     function, but some class of functions only requires one
+     instruction to implement a return.  Normally, the applicable
+     functions are those which do not need to save any registers or
+     allocate stack space.
+
+     For such machines, the condition specified in this pattern should
+     only be true when `reload_completed' is non-zero and the function's
+     epilogue would only be a single instruction.  For machines with
+     register windows, the routine `leaf_function_p' may be used to
+     determine if a register window push is required.
+
+     Machines that have conditional return instructions should define
+     patterns such as
+
+          (define_insn ""
+            [(set (pc)
+                  (if_then_else (match_operator
+                                   0 "comparison_operator"
+                                   [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
+                                (return)
+                                (pc)))]
+            "CONDITION"
+            "...")
+
+     where CONDITION would normally be the same condition specified on
+     the named `return' pattern.
+
+`untyped_return'
+     Untyped subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern
+     should be defined to support `__builtin_return' on machines where
+     special instructions are needed to return a value of any type.
+
+     Operand 0 is a memory location where the result of calling a
+     function with `__builtin_apply' is stored; operand 1 is a
+     `parallel' expression where each element is a `set' expression
+     that indicates the restoring of a function return value from the
+     result block.
+
+`nop'
+     No-op instruction.  This instruction pattern name should always be
+     defined to output a no-op in assembler code.  `(const_int 0)' will
+     do as an RTL pattern.
+
+`indirect_jump'
+     An instruction to jump to an address which is operand zero.  This
+     pattern name is mandatory on all machines.
+
+`casesi'
+     Instruction to jump through a dispatch table, including bounds
+     checking.  This instruction takes five operands:
+
+       1. The index to dispatch on, which has mode `SImode'.
+
+       2. The lower bound for indices in the table, an integer constant.
+
+       3. The total range of indices in the table--the largest index
+          minus the smallest one (both inclusive).
+
+       4. A label that precedes the table itself.
+
+       5. A label to jump to if the index has a value outside the
+          bounds.  (If the machine-description macro
+          `CASE_DROPS_THROUGH' is defined, then an out-of-bounds index
+          drops through to the code following the jump table instead of
+          jumping to this label.  In that case, this label is not
+          actually used by the `casesi' instruction, but it is always
+          provided as an operand.)
+
+     The table is a `addr_vec' or `addr_diff_vec' inside of a
+     `jump_insn'.  The number of elements in the table is one plus the
+     difference between the upper bound and the lower bound.
+
+`tablejump'
+     Instruction to jump to a variable address.  This is a low-level
+     capability which can be used to implement a dispatch table when
+     there is no `casesi' pattern.
+
+     This pattern requires two operands: the address or offset, and a
+     label which should immediately precede the jump table.  If the
+     macro `CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE' evaluates to a nonzero value then
+     the first operand is an offset which counts from the address of
+     the table; otherwise, it is an absolute address to jump to.  In
+     either case, the first operand has mode `Pmode'.
+
+     The `tablejump' insn is always the last insn before the jump table
+     it uses.  Its assembler code normally has no need to use the
+     second operand, but you should incorporate it in the RTL pattern so
+     that the jump optimizer will not delete the table as unreachable
+     code.
+
+`canonicalize_funcptr_for_compare'
+     Canonicalize the function pointer in operand 1 and store the result
+     into operand 0.
+
+     Operand 0 is always a `reg' and has mode `Pmode'; operand 1 may be
+     a `reg', `mem', `symbol_ref', `const_int', etc and also has mode
+     `Pmode'.
+
+     Canonicalization of a function pointer usually involves computing
+     the address of the function which would be called if the function
+     pointer were used in an indirect call.
+
+     Only define this pattern if function pointers on the target machine
+     can have different values but still call the same function when
+     used in an indirect call.
+
+`save_stack_block'
+`save_stack_function'
+`save_stack_nonlocal'
+`restore_stack_block'
+`restore_stack_function'
+`restore_stack_nonlocal'
+     Most machines save and restore the stack pointer by copying it to
+     or from an object of mode `Pmode'.  Do not define these patterns on
+     such machines.
+
+     Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
+     restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to
+     the non-standard cases by using a `define_expand' (*note Expander
+     Definitions::.) that produces the required insns.  The three types
+     of saves and restores are:
+
+       1. `save_stack_block' saves the stack pointer at the start of a
+          block that allocates a variable-sized object, and
+          `restore_stack_block' restores the stack pointer when the
+          block is exited.
+
+       2. `save_stack_function' and `restore_stack_function' do a
+          similar job for the outermost block of a function and are
+          used when the function allocates variable-sized objects or
+          calls `alloca'.  Only the epilogue uses the restored stack
+          pointer, allowing a simpler save or restore sequence on some
+          machines.
+
+       3. `save_stack_nonlocal' is used in functions that contain labels
+          branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer
+          in such a way that the inner function can use
+          `restore_stack_nonlocal' to restore the stack pointer.  The
+          compiler generates code to restore the frame and argument
+          pointer registers, but some machines require saving and
+          restoring additional data such as register window information
+          or stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save
+          and restore any such required data.
+
+     When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and
+     operand 1 is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the
+     save area defaults to `Pmode' but you can override that choice by
+     defining the `STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE' macro (*note Storage
+     Layout::.).  You must specify an integral mode, or `VOIDmode' if
+     no save area is needed for a particular type of save (either
+     because no save is needed or because a machine-specific save area
+     can be used).  Operand 0 is the stack pointer and operand 1 is the
+     save area for restore operations.  If `save_stack_block' is
+     defined, operand 0 must not be `VOIDmode' since these saves can be
+     arbitrarily nested.
+
+     A save area is a `mem' that is at a constant offset from
+     `virtual_stack_vars_rtx' when the stack pointer is saved for use by
+     nonlocal gotos and a `reg' in the other two cases.
+
+`allocate_stack'
+     Subtract (or add if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is undefined) operand 1
+     from the stack pointer to create space for dynamically allocated
+     data.
+
+     Store the resultant pointer to this space into operand 0.  If you
+     are allocating space from the main stack, do this by emitting a
+     move insn to copy `virtual_stack_dynamic_rtx' to operand 0.  If
+     you are allocating the space elsewhere, generate code to copy the
+     location of the space to operand 0.  In the latter case, you must
+     ensure this space gets freed when the corresponding space on the
+     main stack is free.
+
+     Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the
+     subtraction.  Some machines require other operations such as stack
+     probes or maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit
+     those operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.
+
+`probe'
+     Some machines require instructions to be executed after space is
+     allocated from the stack, for example to generate a reference at
+     the bottom of the stack.
+
+     If you need to emit instructions before the stack has been
+     adjusted, put them into the `allocate_stack' pattern.  Otherwise,
+     define this pattern to emit the required instructions.
+
+     No operands are provided.
+
+`check_stack'
+     If stack checking cannot be done on your system by probing the
+     stack with a load or store instruction (*note Stack Checking::.),
+     define this pattern to perform the needed check and signaling an
+     error if the stack has overflowed.  The single operand is the
+     location in the stack furthest from the current stack pointer that
+     you need to validate.  Normally, on machines where this pattern is
+     needed, you would obtain the stack limit from a global or
+     thread-specific variable or register.
+
+`nonlocal_goto'
+     Emit code to generate a non-local goto, e.g., a jump from one
+     function to a label in an outer function.  This pattern has four
+     arguments, each representing a value to be used in the jump.  The
+     first argument is to be loaded into the frame pointer, the second
+     is the address to branch to (code to dispatch to the actual label),
+     the third is the address of a location where the stack is saved,
+     and the last is the address of the label, to be placed in the
+     location for the incoming static chain.
+
+     On most machines you need not define this pattern, since GNU CC
+     will already generate the correct code, which is to load the frame
+     pointer and static chain, restore the stack (using the
+     `restore_stack_nonlocal' pattern, if defined), and jump indirectly
+     to the dispatcher.  You need only define this pattern if this code
+     will not work on your machine.
+
+`nonlocal_goto_receiver'
+     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the target of a
+     nonlocal goto after the code already generated by GNU CC.  You
+     will not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical reason
+     why you might need this pattern is if some value, such as a
+     pointer to a global table, must be restored when the frame pointer
+     is restored.  Note that a nonlocal goto only ocurrs within a
+     unit-of-translation, so a global table pointer that is shared by
+     all functions of a given module need not be restored.  There are
+     no arguments.
+
+`exception_receiver'
+     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of an
+     exception handler that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal
+     goto.  You will not normally need to define this pattern.  A
+     typical reason why you might need this pattern is if some value,
+     such as a pointer to a global table, must be restored after
+     control flow is branched to the handler of an exception.  There
+     are no arguments.
+
+`builtin_setjmp_setup'
+     This pattern, if defined, contains additional code needed to
+     initialize the `jmp_buf'.  You will not normally need to define
+     this pattern.  A typical reason why you might need this pattern is
+     if some value, such as a pointer to a global table, must be
+     restored.  Though it is preferred that the pointer value be
+     recalculated if possible (given the address of a label for
+     instance).  The single argument is a pointer to the `jmp_buf'.
+     Note that the buffer is five words long and that the first three
+     are normally used by the generic mechanism.
+
+`builtin_setjmp_receiver'
+     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of an
+     builtin setjmp that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal goto.
+     You will not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical
+     reason why you might need this pattern is if some value, such as a
+     pointer to a global table, must be restored.  It takes one
+     argument, which is the label to which builtin_longjmp transfered
+     control; this pattern may be emitted at a small offset from that
+     label.
+
+`builtin_longjmp'
+     This pattern, if defined, performs the entire action of the
+     longjmp.  You will not normally need to define this pattern unless
+     you also define `builtin_setjmp_setup'.  The single argument is a
+     pointer to the `jmp_buf'.
+
+`eh_epilogue'
+     This pattern, if defined, affects the way `__builtin_eh_return',
+     and thence `__throw' are built.  It is intended to allow
+     communication between the exception handling machinery and the
+     normal epilogue code for the target.
+
+     The pattern takes three arguments.  The first is the exception
+     context pointer.  This will have already been copied to the
+     function return register appropriate for a pointer; normally this
+     can be ignored.  The second argument is an offset to be added to
+     the stack pointer.  It will have been copied to some arbitrary
+     call-clobbered hard reg so that it will survive until after reload
+     to when the normal epilogue is generated.  The final argument is
+     the address of the exception handler to which the function should
+     return.  This will normally need to copied by the pattern to some
+     special register.
+
+     This pattern must be defined if `RETURN_ADDR_RTX' does not yield
+     something that can be reliably and permanently modified, i.e. a
+     fixed hard register or a stack memory reference.
+
+`prologue'
+     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for entry to a function.  The
+     function entry is resposible for setting up the stack frame,
+     initializing the frame pointer register, saving callee saved
+     registers, etc.
+
+     Using a prologue pattern is generally preferred over defining
+     `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' to emit assembly code for the prologue.
+
+     The `prologue' pattern is particularly useful for targets which
+     perform instruction scheduling.
+
+`epilogue'
+     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for exit from a function.  The
+     function exit is resposible for deallocating the stack frame,
+     restoring callee saved registers and emitting the return
+     instruction.
+
+     Using an epilogue pattern is generally preferred over defining
+     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to emit assembly code for the prologue.
+
+     The `epilogue' pattern is particularly useful for targets which
+     perform instruction scheduling or which have delay slots for their
+     return instruction.
+
+`sibcall_epilogue'
+     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for exit from a function
+     without the final branch back to the calling function.  This
+     pattern will be emitted before any sibling call (aka tail call)
+     sites.
+
+     The `sibcall_epilogue' pattern must not clobber any arguments used
+     for parameter passing or any stack slots for arguments passed to
+     the current function.

+
+When the Order of Patterns Matters
+==================================
+
+   Sometimes an insn can match more than one instruction pattern.  Then
+the pattern that appears first in the machine description is the one
+used.  Therefore, more specific patterns (patterns that will match
+fewer things) and faster instructions (those that will produce better
+code when they do match) should usually go first in the description.
+
+   In some cases the effect of ordering the patterns can be used to hide
+a pattern when it is not valid.  For example, the 68000 has an
+instruction for converting a fullword to floating point and another for
+converting a byte to floating point.  An instruction converting an
+integer to floating point could match either one.  We put the pattern
+to convert the fullword first to make sure that one will be used rather
+than the other.  (Otherwise a large integer might be generated as a
+single-byte immediate quantity, which would not work.)  Instead of
+using this pattern ordering it would be possible to make the pattern
+for convert-a-byte smart enough to deal properly with any constant
+value.

+
+Options Controlling C++ Dialect
+===============================
+
+   This section describes the command-line options that are only
+meaningful for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU
+compiler options regardless of what language your program is in.  For
+example, you might compile a file `firstClass.C' like this:
+
+     g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
+
+In this example, only `-frepo' is an option meant only for C++
+programs; you can use the other options with any language supported by
+GCC.
+
+   Here is a list of options that are *only* for compiling C++ programs:
+
+`-fno-access-control'
+     Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for
+     working around bugs in the access control code.
+
+`-fcheck-new'
+     Check that the pointer returned by `operator new' is non-null
+     before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  The current
+     Working Paper requires that `operator new' never return a null
+     pointer, so this check is normally unnecessary.
+
+     An alternative to using this option is to specify that your
+     `operator new' does not throw any exceptions; if you declare it
+     `throw()', g++ will check the return value.  See also `new
+     (nothrow)'.
+
+`-fconserve-space'
+     Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
+     common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at
+     the cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile
+     with this flag and your program mysteriously crashes after
+     `main()' has completed, you may have an object that is being
+     destroyed twice because two definitions were merged.
+
+     This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support
+     has been added for putting variables into BSS without making them
+     common.
+
+`-fdollars-in-identifiers'
+     Accept `$' in identifiers.  You can also explicitly prohibit use of
+     `$' with the option `-fno-dollars-in-identifiers'.  (GNU C allows
+     `$' by default on most target systems, but there are a few
+     exceptions.)  Traditional C allowed the character `$' to form part
+     of identifiers.  However, ANSI C and C++ forbid `$' in identifiers.
+
+`-fno-elide-constructors'
+     The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a
+     temporary which is only used to initialize another object of the
+     same type.  Specifying this option disables that optimization, and
+     forces g++ to call the copy constructor in all cases.
+
+`-fexternal-templates'
+     Cause template instantiations to obey `#pragma interface' and
+     `implementation'; template instances are emitted or not according
+     to the location of the template definition.  *Note Template
+     Instantiation::, for more information.
+
+     This option is deprecated.
+
+`-falt-external-templates'
+     Similar to -fexternal-templates, but template instances are
+     emitted or not according to the place where they are first
+     instantiated.  *Note Template Instantiation::, for more
+     information.
+
+     This option is deprecated.
+
+`-ffor-scope'
+`-fno-for-scope'
+     If -ffor-scope is specified, the scope of variables declared in a
+     for-init-statement is limited to the `for' loop itself, as
+     specified by the draft C++ standard.  If -fno-for-scope is
+     specified, the scope of variables declared in a for-init-statement
+     extends to the end of the enclosing scope, as was the case in old
+     versions of gcc, and other (traditional) implementations of C++.
+
+     The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard, but
+     to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
+     otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
+
+`-fno-gnu-keywords'
+     Do not recognize `classof', `headof', `signature', `sigof' or
+     `typeof' as a keyword, so that code can use these words as
+     identifiers.  You can use the keywords `__classof__',
+     `__headof__', `__signature__', `__sigof__', and `__typeof__'
+     instead.  `-ansi' implies `-fno-gnu-keywords'.
+
+`-fguiding-decls'
+     Treat a function declaration with the same type as a potential
+     function template instantiation as though it declares that
+     instantiation, not a normal function.  If a definition is given
+     for the function later in the translation unit (or another
+     translation unit if the target supports weak symbols), that
+     definition will be used; otherwise the template will be
+     instantiated.  This behavior reflects the C++ language prior to
+     September 1996, when guiding declarations were removed.
+
+     This option implies `-fname-mangling-version-0', and will not work
+     with other name mangling versions.  Like all options that change
+     the ABI, all C++ code, *including libgcc.a* must be built with the
+     same setting of this option.
+
+`-fhandle-signatures'
+     Recognize the `signature' and `sigof' keywords for specifying
+     abstract types.  The default (`-fno-handle-signatures') is not to
+     recognize them.  *Note Type Abstraction using Signatures: C++
+     Signatures.
+
+`-fhonor-std'
+     Treat the `namespace std' as a namespace, instead of ignoring it.
+     For compatibility with earlier versions of g++, the compiler will,
+     by default, ignore `namespace-declarations', `using-declarations',
+     `using-directives', and `namespace-names', if they involve `std'.
+
+`-fhuge-objects'
+     Support virtual function calls for objects that exceed the size
+     representable by a `short int'.  Users should not use this flag by
+     default; if you need to use it, the compiler will tell you so.
+
+     This flag is not useful when compiling with -fvtable-thunks.
+
+     Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, *including
+     libgcc* must be built with the same setting of this option.
+
+`-fno-implicit-templates'
+     Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
+     implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit
+     instantiations.  *Note Template Instantiation::, for more
+     information.
+
+`-fno-implicit-inline-templates'
+     Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates,
+     either.  The default is to handle inlines differently so that
+     compiles with and without optimization will need the same set of
+     explicit instantiations.
+
+`-finit-priority'
+     Support `__attribute__ ((init_priority (n)))' for controlling the
+     order of initialization of file-scope objects.  On ELF targets,
+     this requires GNU ld 2.10 or later.
+
+`-fno-implement-inlines'
+     To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
+     controlled by `#pragma implementation'.  This will cause linker
+     errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are
+     called.
+
+`-fname-mangling-version-N'
+     Control the way in which names are mangled.  Version 0 is
+     compatible with versions of g++ before 2.8.  Version 1 is the
+     default.  Version 1 will allow correct mangling of function
+     templates.  For example, version 0 mangling does not mangle
+     foo<int, double> and foo<int, char> given this declaration:
+
+          template <class T, class U> void foo(T t);
+
+     Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, *including
+     libgcc* must be built with the same setting of this option.
+
+`-foperator-names'
+     Recognize the operator name keywords `and', `bitand', `bitor',
+     `compl', `not', `or' and `xor' as synonyms for the symbols they
+     refer to.  `-ansi' implies `-foperator-names'.
+
+`-fno-optional-diags'
+     Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not
+     need to issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by g++
+     is the one for a name having multiple meanings within a class.
+
+`-fpermissive'
+     Downgrade messages about nonconformant code from errors to
+     warnings.  By default, g++ effectively sets `-pedantic-errors'
+     without `-pedantic'; this option reverses that.  This behavior and
+     this option are superceded by `-pedantic', which works as it does
+     for GNU C.
+
+`-frepo'
+     Enable automatic template instantiation.  This option also implies
+     `-fno-implicit-templates'.  *Note Template Instantiation::, for
+     more information.
+
+`-fno-rtti'
+     Disable generation of the information used by C++ runtime type
+     identification features (`dynamic_cast' and `typeid').  If you
+     don't use those parts of the language (or exception handling,
+     which uses `dynamic_cast' internally), you can save some space by
+     using this flag.
+
+`-fstrict-prototype'
+     Within an `extern "C"' linkage specification, treat a function
+     declaration with no arguments, such as `int foo ();', as declaring
+     the function to take no arguments.  Normally, such a declaration
+     means that the function `foo' can take any combination of
+     arguments, as in C.  `-pedantic' implies `-fstrict-prototype'
+     unless overridden with `-fno-strict-prototype'.
+
+     Specifying this option will also suppress implicit declarations of
+     functions.
+
+     This flag no longer affects declarations with C++ linkage.
+
+`-fsquangle'
+`-fno-squangle'
+     `-fsquangle' will enable a compressed form of name mangling for
+     identifiers. In particular, it helps to shorten very long names by
+     recognizing types and class names which occur more than once,
+     replacing them with special short ID codes.  This option also
+     requires any C++ libraries being used to be compiled with this
+     option as well.  The compiler has this disabled (the equivalent of
+     `-fno-squangle') by default.
+
+     Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, *including
+     libgcc.a* must be built with the same setting of this option.
+
+`-ftemplate-depth-N'
+     Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to N.  A
+     limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
+     endless recursions during template class instantiation. ANSI/ISO
+     C++ conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater
+     than 17.
+
+`-fthis-is-variable'
+     Permit assignment to `this'.  The incorporation of user-defined
+     free store management into C++ has made assignment to `this' an
+     anachronism.  Therefore, by default it is invalid to assign to
+     `this' within a class member function; that is, GNU C++ treats
+     `this' in a member function of class `X' as a non-lvalue of type
+     `X *'.  However, for backwards compatibility, you can make it
+     valid with `-fthis-is-variable'.
+
+`-fvtable-thunks'
+     Use `thunks' to implement the virtual function dispatch table
+     (`vtable').  The traditional (cfront-style) approach to
+     implementing vtables was to store a pointer to the function and two
+     offsets for adjusting the `this' pointer at the call site.  Newer
+     implementations store a single pointer to a `thunk' function which
+     does any necessary adjustment and then calls the target function.
+
+     This option also enables a heuristic for controlling emission of
+     vtables; if a class has any non-inline virtual functions, the
+     vtable will be emitted in the translation unit containing the
+     first one of those.
+
+     Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, *including
+     libgcc.a* must be built with the same setting of this option.
+
+`-nostdinc++'
+     Do not search for header files in the standard directories
+     specific to C++, but do still search the other standard
+     directories.  (This option is used when building the C++ library.)
+
+   In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
+have meanings only for C++ programs:
+
+`-fno-default-inline'
+     Do not assume `inline' for functions defined inside a class scope.
+     *Note Options That Control Optimization: Optimize Options.  Note
+     that these functions will have linkage like inline functions; they
+     just won't be inlined by default.
+
+`-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ only)'
+     Warn when a class seems unusable, because all the constructors or
+     destructors in a class are private and the class has no friends or
+     public static member functions.
+
+`-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ only)'
+     Warn when a class declares a non-virtual destructor that should
+     probably be virtual, because it looks like the class will be used
+     polymorphically.
+
+`-Wreorder (C++ only)'
+     Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does
+     not match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:
+
+          struct A {
+            int i;
+            int j;
+            A(): j (0), i (1) { }
+          };
+
+     Here the compiler will warn that the member initializers for `i'
+     and `j' will be rearranged to match the declaration order of the
+     members.
+
+   The following `-W...' options are not affected by `-Wall'.
+
+`-Weffc++ (C++ only)'
+     Warn about violations of various style guidelines from Scott
+     Meyers' `Effective C++' books.  If you use this option, you should
+     be aware that the standard library headers do not obey all of
+     these guidelines; you can use `grep -v' to filter out those
+     warnings.
+
+`-Wno-deprecated (C++ only)'
+     Do not warn about usage of deprecated features. *Note Deprecated
+     Features::.
+
+`-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ only)'
+     Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
+     within a template. With the advent of explicit template
+     specification support in g++, if the name of the friend is an
+     unqualified-id (ie, `friend foo(int)'), the C++ language
+     specification demands that the friend declare or define an
+     ordinary, nontemplate function. (Section 14.5.3). Before g++
+     implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids could be
+     interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
+     function. Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the
+     default behavior for g++, `-Wnon-template-friend' allows the
+     compiler to check existing code for potential trouble spots, and
+     is on by default.  This new compiler behavior can also be turned
+     off with the flag `-fguiding-decls', which activates the older,
+     non-specification compiler code, or with
+     `-Wno-non-template-friend' which keeps the conformant compiler
+     code but disables the helpful warning.
+
+`-Wold-style-cast (C++ only)'
+     Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast is used within a C++ program.
+     The new-style casts (`static_cast', `reinterpret_cast', and
+     `const_cast') are less vulnerable to unintended effects.
+
+`-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ only)'
+     Warn when a derived class function declaration may be an error in
+     defining a virtual function.  In a derived class, the definitions
+     of virtual functions must match the type signature of a virtual
+     function declared in the base class.  With this option, the
+     compiler warns when you define a function with the same name as a
+     virtual function, but with a type signature that does not match any
+     declarations from the base class.
+
+`-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ only)'
+     Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member
+     function to a plain pointer.
+
+`-Wsign-promo (C++ only)'
+     Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
+     enumeral type to a signed type over a conversion to an unsigned
+     type of the same size.  Previous versions of g++ would try to
+     preserve unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current
+     behavior.
+
+`-Wsynth (C++ only)'
+     Warn when g++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.
+     For instance:
+
+          struct A {
+            operator int ();
+            A& operator = (int);
+          };
+          
+          main ()
+          {
+            A a,b;
+            a = b;
+          }
+
+     In this example, g++ will synthesize a default `A& operator =
+     (const A&);', while cfront will use the user-defined `operator ='.

+
+Options to Request or Suppress Warnings
+=======================================
+
+   Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are
+not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there may have
+been an error.
+
+   You can request many specific warnings with options beginning `-W',
+for example `-Wimplicit' to request warnings on implicit declarations.
+Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form
+beginning `-Wno-' to turn off warnings; for example, `-Wno-implicit'.
+This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the
+default.
+
+   These options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by
+GCC:
+
+`-fsyntax-only'
+     Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond
+     that.
+
+`-pedantic'
+     Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI C and ISO C++;
+     reject all programs that use forbidden extensions.
+
+     Valid ANSI C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or
+     without this option (though a rare few will require `-ansi').
+     However, without this option, certain GNU extensions and
+     traditional C and C++ features are supported as well.  With this
+     option, they are rejected.
+
+     `-pedantic' does not cause warning messages for use of the
+     alternate keywords whose names begin and end with `__'.  Pedantic
+     warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
+     `__extension__'.  However, only system header files should use
+     these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
+     *Note Alternate Keywords::.
+
+     This option is not intended to be useful; it exists only to satisfy
+     pedants who would otherwise claim that GCC fails to support the
+     ANSI standard.
+
+     Some users try to use `-pedantic' to check programs for strict ANSI
+     C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they
+     want: it finds some non-ANSI practices, but not all--only those
+     for which ANSI C *requires* a diagnostic.
+
+     A feature to report any failure to conform to ANSI C might be
+     useful in some instances, but would require considerable
+     additional work and would be quite different from `-pedantic'.  We
+     don't have plans to support such a feature in the near future.
+
+`-pedantic-errors'
+     Like `-pedantic', except that errors are produced rather than
+     warnings.
+
+`-w'
+     Inhibit all warning messages.
+
+`-Wno-import'
+     Inhibit warning messages about the use of `#import'.
+
+`-Wchar-subscripts'
+     Warn if an array subscript has type `char'.  This is a common cause
+     of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on
+     some machines.
+
+`-Wcomment'
+     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears in a `/*'
+     comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a `//' comment.
+
+`-Wformat'
+     Check calls to `printf' and `scanf', etc., to make sure that the
+     arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
+     specified.
+
+`-Wimplicit-int'
+     Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.
+
+`-Wimplicit-function-declaration'
+`-Werror-implicit-function-declaration'
+     Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being
+     declared.
+
+`-Wimplicit'
+     Same as `-Wimplicit-int' and `-Wimplicit-function-'
+     `declaration'.
+
+`-Wmain'
+     Warn if the type of `main' is suspicious.  `main' should be a
+     function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
+     arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.
+
+`-Wmultichar'
+     Warn if a multicharacter constant (`'FOOF'') is used.  Usually they
+     indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
+     implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable
+     code.
+
+`-Wparentheses'
+     Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when
+     there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is
+     expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
+     often get confused about.
+
+     Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
+     `if' statement an `else' branch belongs.  Here is an example of
+     such a case:
+
+          {
+            if (a)
+              if (b)
+                foo ();
+            else
+              bar ();
+          }
+
+     In C, every `else' branch belongs to the innermost possible `if'
+     statement, which in this example is `if (b)'.  This is often not
+     what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example
+     by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential
+     for this confusion, GNU C will issue a warning when this flag is
+     specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
+     the innermost `if' statement so there is no way the `else' could
+     belong to the enclosing `if'.  The resulting code would look like
+     this:
+
+          {
+            if (a)
+              {
+                if (b)
+                  foo ();
+                else
+                  bar ();
+              }
+          }
+
+`-Wreturn-type'
+     Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that
+     defaults to `int'.  Also warn about any `return' statement with no
+     return-value in a function whose return-type is not `void'.
+
+`-Wswitch'
+     Warn whenever a `switch' statement has an index of enumeral type
+     and lacks a `case' for one or more of the named codes of that
+     enumeration.  (The presence of a `default' label prevents this
+     warning.)  `case' labels outside the enumeration range also
+     provoke warnings when this option is used.
+
+`-Wtrigraphs'
+     Warn if any trigraphs are encountered (assuming they are enabled).
+
+`-Wunused'
+     Warn whenever a variable is unused aside from its declaration,
+     whenever a function is declared static but never defined, whenever
+     a label is declared but not used, and whenever a statement
+     computes a result that is explicitly not used.
+
+     In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you
+     must specify both `-W' and `-Wunused'.
+
+     To suppress this warning for an expression, simply cast it to
+     void.  For unused variables, parameters and labels, use the
+     `unused' attribute (*note Variable Attributes::.).
+
+`-Wuninitialized'
+     An automatic variable is used without first being initialized.
+
+     These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
+     because they require data flow information that is computed only
+     when optimizing.  If you don't specify `-O', you simply won't get
+     these warnings.
+
+     These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
+     register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable
+     that is declared `volatile', or whose address is taken, or whose
+     size is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
+     structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.
+
+     Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used
+     only to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
+     computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the
+     warnings are printed.
+
+     These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart enough
+     to see all the reasons why the code might be correct despite
+     appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how this can
+     happen:
+
+          {
+            int x;
+            switch (y)
+              {
+              case 1: x = 1;
+                break;
+              case 2: x = 4;
+                break;
+              case 3: x = 5;
+              }
+            foo (x);
+          }
+
+     If the value of `y' is always 1, 2 or 3, then `x' is always
+     initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is another common
+     case:
+
+          {
+            int save_y;
+            if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
+            ...
+            if (change_y) y = save_y;
+          }
+
+     This has no bug because `save_y' is used only if it is set.
+
+     Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the
+     functions you use that never return as `noreturn'.  *Note Function
+     Attributes::.
+
+`-Wunknown-pragmas'
+     Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not
+     understood by GCC.  If this command line option is used, warnings
+     will even be issued for unknown pragmas in system header files.
+     This is not the case if the warnings were only enabled by the
+     `-Wall' command line option.
+
+`-Wall'
+     All of the above `-W' options combined.  This enables all the
+     warnings about constructions that some users consider
+     questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the
+     warning), even in conjunction with macros.
+
+   The following `-W...' options are not implied by `-Wall'.  Some of
+them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
+questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
+others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
+some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
+the warning.
+
+`-W'
+     Print extra warning messages for these events:
+
+        * A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
+          `longjmp'.  These warnings as well are possible only in
+          optimizing compilation.
+
+          The compiler sees only the calls to `setjmp'.  It cannot know
+          where `longjmp' will be called; in fact, a signal handler
+          could call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may
+          get a warning even when there is in fact no problem because
+          `longjmp' cannot in fact be called at the place which would
+          cause a problem.
+
+        * A function can return either with or without a value.
+          (Falling off the end of the function body is considered
+          returning without a value.)  For example, this function would
+          evoke such a warning:
+
+               foo (a)
+               {
+                 if (a > 0)
+                   return a;
+               }
+
+        * An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma
+          expression contains no side effects.  To suppress the
+          warning, cast the unused expression to void.  For example, an
+          expression such as `x[i,j]' will cause a warning, but
+          `x[(void)i,j]' will not.
+
+        * An unsigned value is compared against zero with `<' or `<='.
+
+        * A comparison like `x<=y<=z' appears; this is equivalent to
+          `(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z', which is a different interpretation
+          from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
+
+        * Storage-class specifiers like `static' are not the first
+          things in a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this
+          usage is obsolescent.
+
+        * If `-Wall' or `-Wunused' is also specified, warn about unused
+          arguments.
+
+        * A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
+          an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to
+          unsigned.  (But don't warn if `-Wno-sign-compare' is also
+          specified.)
+
+        * An aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer.  For
+          example, the following code would evoke such a warning,
+          because braces are missing around the initializer for `x.h':
+
+               struct s { int f, g; };
+               struct t { struct s h; int i; };
+               struct t x = { 1, 2, 3 };
+
+        * An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all
+          members.  For example, the following code would cause such a
+          warning, because `x.h' would be implicitly initialized to
+          zero:
+
+               struct s { int f, g, h; };
+               struct s x = { 3, 4 };
+
+`-Wtraditional'
+     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
+     traditional and ANSI C.
+
+        * Macro arguments occurring within string constants in the
+          macro body.  These would substitute the argument in
+          traditional C, but are part of the constant in ANSI C.
+
+        * A function declared external in one block and then used after
+          the end of the block.
+
+        * A `switch' statement has an operand of type `long'.
+
+        * A non-`static' function declaration follows a `static' one.
+          This construct is not accepted by some traditional C
+          compilers.
+
+`-Wundef'
+     Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an `#if' directive.
+
+`-Wshadow'
+     Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable.
+
+`-Wid-clash-LEN'
+     Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first LEN
+     characters.  This may help you prepare a program that will compile
+     with certain obsolete, brain-damaged compilers.
+
+`-Wlarger-than-LEN'
+     Warn whenever an object of larger than LEN bytes is defined.
+
+`-Wpointer-arith'
+     Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type
+     or of `void'.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
+     convenience in calculations with `void *' pointers and pointers to
+     functions.
+
+`-Wbad-function-cast'
+     Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.  For
+     example, warn if `int malloc()' is cast to `anything *'.
+
+`-Wcast-qual'
+     Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier
+     from the target type.  For example, warn if a `const char *' is
+     cast to an ordinary `char *'.
+
+`-Wcast-align'
+     Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment
+     of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a `char *' is
+     cast to an `int *' on machines where integers can only be accessed
+     at two- or four-byte boundaries.
+
+`-Wwrite-strings'
+     Give string constants the type `const char[LENGTH]' so that
+     copying the address of one into a non-`const' `char *' pointer
+     will get a warning.  These warnings will help you find at compile
+     time code that can try to write into a string constant, but only
+     if you have been very careful about using `const' in declarations
+     and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance; this is
+     why we did not make `-Wall' request these warnings.
+
+`-Wconversion'
+     Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different
+     from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
+     prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating
+     and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness
+     of a fixed point argument except when the same as the default
+     promotion.
+
+     Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
+     converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the
+     assignment `x = -1' if `x' is unsigned.  But do not warn about
+     explicit casts like `(unsigned) -1'.
+
+`-Wsign-compare'
+     Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could
+     produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to
+     unsigned.  This warning is also enabled by `-W'; to get the other
+     warnings of `-W' without this warning, use `-W -Wno-sign-compare'.
+
+`-Waggregate-return'
+     Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined
+     or called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also
+     elicits a warning.)
+
+`-Wstrict-prototypes'
+     Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
+     argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted
+     without a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the
+     argument types.)
+
+`-Wmissing-prototypes'
+     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
+     declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
+     provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that
+     fail to be declared in header files.
+
+`-Wmissing-declarations'
+     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
+     declaration.  Do so even if the definition itself provides a
+     prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions that are
+     not declared in header files.
+
+`-Wmissing-noreturn'
+     Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute
+     `noreturn'.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute
+     ones.  Care should be taken to manually verify functions actually
+     do not ever return before adding the `noreturn' attribute,
+     otherwise subtle code generation bugs could be introduced.
+
+`-Wredundant-decls'
+     Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope,
+     even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes
+     nothing.
+
+`-Wnested-externs'
+     Warn if an `extern' declaration is encountered within an function.
+
+`-Winline'
+     Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared
+     as inline, or else the `-finline-functions' option was given.
+
+`-Wlong-long'
+     Warn if `long long' type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
+     the warning messages, use `-Wno-long-long'.  Flags `-Wlong-long'
+     and `-Wno-long-long' are taken into account only when `-pedantic'
+     flag is used.
+
+`-Werror'
+     Make all warnings into errors.

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Dependent Patterns,  Next: Jump Patterns,  Prev: Pattern Ordering,  Up: Machine Desc
+
+Interdependence of Patterns
+===========================
+
+   Every machine description must have a named pattern for each of the
+conditional branch names `bCOND'.  The recognition template must always
+have the form
+
+     (set (pc)
+          (if_then_else (COND (cc0) (const_int 0))
+                        (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))
+                        (pc)))
+
+In addition, every machine description must have an anonymous pattern
+for each of the possible reverse-conditional branches.  Their templates
+look like
+
+     (set (pc)
+          (if_then_else (COND (cc0) (const_int 0))
+                        (pc)
+                        (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))))
+
+They are necessary because jump optimization can turn direct-conditional
+branches into reverse-conditional branches.
+
+   It is often convenient to use the `match_operator' construct to
+reduce the number of patterns that must be specified for branches.  For
+example,
+
+     (define_insn ""
+       [(set (pc)
+             (if_then_else (match_operator 0 "comparison_operator"
+                                           [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
+                           (pc)
+                           (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))))]
+       "CONDITION"
+       "...")
+
+   In some cases machines support instructions identical except for the
+machine mode of one or more operands.  For example, there may be
+"sign-extend halfword" and "sign-extend byte" instructions whose
+patterns are
+
+     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
+          (extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 ...)))
+     
+     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
+          (extend:SI (match_operand:QI 1 ...)))
+
+Constant integers do not specify a machine mode, so an instruction to
+extend a constant value could match either pattern.  The pattern it
+actually will match is the one that appears first in the file.  For
+correct results, this must be the one for the widest possible mode
+(`HImode', here).  If the pattern matches the `QImode' instruction, the
+results will be incorrect if the constant value does not actually fit
+that mode.
+
+   Such instructions to extend constants are rarely generated because
+they are optimized away, but they do occasionally happen in nonoptimized
+compilations.
+
+   If a constraint in a pattern allows a constant, the reload pass may
+replace a register with a constant permitted by the constraint in some
+cases.  Similarly for memory references.  Because of this substitution,
+you should not provide separate patterns for increment and decrement
+instructions.  Instead, they should be generated from the same pattern
+that supports register-register add insns by examining the operands and
+generating the appropriate machine instruction.

+
+Defining Jump Instruction Patterns
+==================================
+
+   For most machines, GNU CC assumes that the machine has a condition
+code.  A comparison insn sets the condition code, recording the results
+of both signed and unsigned comparison of the given operands.  A
+separate branch insn tests the condition code and branches or not
+according its value.  The branch insns come in distinct signed and
+unsigned flavors.  Many common machines, such as the Vax, the 68000 and
+the 32000, work this way.
+
+   Some machines have distinct signed and unsigned compare
+instructions, and only one set of conditional branch instructions.  The
+easiest way to handle these machines is to treat them just like the
+others until the final stage where assembly code is written.  At this
+time, when outputting code for the compare instruction, peek ahead at
+the following branch using `next_cc0_user (insn)'.  (The variable
+`insn' refers to the insn being output, in the output-writing code in
+an instruction pattern.)  If the RTL says that is an unsigned branch,
+output an unsigned compare; otherwise output a signed compare.  When
+the branch itself is output, you can treat signed and unsigned branches
+identically.
+
+   The reason you can do this is that GNU CC always generates a pair of
+consecutive RTL insns, possibly separated by `note' insns, one to set
+the condition code and one to test it, and keeps the pair inviolate
+until the end.
+
+   To go with this technique, you must define the machine-description
+macro `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to do `CC_STATUS_INIT'; in other words, no
+compare instruction is superfluous.
+
+   Some machines have compare-and-branch instructions and no condition
+code.  A similar technique works for them.  When it is time to "output"
+a compare instruction, record its operands in two static variables.
+When outputting the branch-on-condition-code instruction that follows,
+actually output a compare-and-branch instruction that uses the
+remembered operands.
+
+   It also works to define patterns for compare-and-branch instructions.
+In optimizing compilation, the pair of compare and branch instructions
+will be combined according to these patterns.  But this does not happen
+if optimization is not requested.  So you must use one of the solutions
+above in addition to any special patterns you define.
+
+   In many RISC machines, most instructions do not affect the condition
+code and there may not even be a separate condition code register.  On
+these machines, the restriction that the definition and use of the
+condition code be adjacent insns is not necessary and can prevent
+important optimizations.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there is a
+delay for taken branches unless the condition code register is set three
+instructions earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction
+scheduler cannot perform this optimization if it is not permitted to
+separate the definition and use of the condition code register.
+
+   On these machines, do not use `(cc0)', but instead use a register to
+represent the condition code.  If there is a specific condition code
+register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the condition code or
+comparison result can be placed in any general register, or if there are
+multiple condition registers, use a pseudo register.
+
+   On some machines, the type of branch instruction generated may
+depend on the way the condition code was produced; for example, on the
+68k and Sparc, setting the condition code directly from an add or
+subtract instruction does not clear the overflow bit the way that a test
+instruction does, so a different branch instruction must be used for
+some conditional branches.  For machines that use `(cc0)', the set and
+use of the condition code must be adjacent (separated only by `note'
+insns) allowing flags in `cc_status' to be used.  (*Note Condition
+Code::.)  Also, the comparison and branch insns can be located from
+each other by using the functions `prev_cc0_setter' and `next_cc0_user'.
+
+   However, this is not true on machines that do not use `(cc0)'.  On
+those machines, no assumptions can be made about the adjacency of the
+compare and branch insns and the above methods cannot be used.  Instead,
+we use the machine mode of the condition code register to record
+different formats of the condition code register.
+
+   Registers used to store the condition code value should have a mode
+that is in class `MODE_CC'.  Normally, it will be `CCmode'.  If
+additional modes are required (as for the add example mentioned above in
+the Sparc), define the macro `EXTRA_CC_MODES' to list the additional
+modes required (*note Condition Code::.).  Also define `EXTRA_CC_NAMES'
+to list the names of those modes and `SELECT_CC_MODE' to choose a mode
+given an operand of a compare.
+
+   If it is known during RTL generation that a different mode will be
+required (for example, if the machine has separate compare instructions
+for signed and unsigned quantities, like most IBM processors), they can
+be specified at that time.
+
+   If the cases that require different modes would be made by
+instruction combination, the macro `SELECT_CC_MODE' determines which
+machine mode should be used for the comparison result.  The patterns
+should be written using that mode.  To support the case of the add on
+the Sparc discussed above, we have the pattern
+
+     (define_insn ""
+       [(set (reg:CC_NOOV 0)
+             (compare:CC_NOOV
+               (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")
+                        (match_operand:SI 1 "arith_operand" "rI"))
+               (const_int 0)))]
+       ""
+       "...")
+
+   The `SELECT_CC_MODE' macro on the Sparc returns `CC_NOOVmode' for
+comparisons whose argument is a `plus'.

+
+Canonicalization of Instructions
+================================
+
+   There are often cases where multiple RTL expressions could represent
+an operation performed by a single machine instruction.  This situation
+is most commonly encountered with logical, branch, and
+multiply-accumulate instructions.  In such cases, the compiler attempts
+to convert these multiple RTL expressions into a single canonical form
+to reduce the number of insn patterns required.
+
+   In addition to algebraic simplifications, following canonicalizations
+are performed:
+
+   * For commutative and comparison operators, a constant is always
+     made the second operand.  If a machine only supports a constant as
+     the second operand, only patterns that match a constant in the
+     second operand need be supplied.
+
+     For these operators, if only one operand is a `neg', `not',
+     `mult', `plus', or `minus' expression, it will be the first
+     operand.
+
+   * For the `compare' operator, a constant is always the second operand
+     on machines where `cc0' is used (*note Jump Patterns::.).  On other
+     machines, there are rare cases where the compiler might want to
+     construct a `compare' with a constant as the first operand.
+     However, these cases are not common enough for it to be worthwhile
+     to provide a pattern matching a constant as the first operand
+     unless the machine actually has such an instruction.
+
+     An operand of `neg', `not', `mult', `plus', or `minus' is made the
+     first operand under the same conditions as above.
+
+   * `(minus X (const_int N))' is converted to `(plus X (const_int
+     -N))'.
+
+   * Within address computations (i.e., inside `mem'), a left shift is
+     converted into the appropriate multiplication by a power of two.
+
+   * De`Morgan's Law is used to move bitwise negation inside a bitwise
+     logical-and or logical-or operation.  If this results in only one
+     operand being a `not' expression, it will be the first one.
+
+     A machine that has an instruction that performs a bitwise
+     logical-and of one operand with the bitwise negation of the other
+     should specify the pattern for that instruction as
+
+          (define_insn ""
+            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
+                  (and:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
+                               (match_operand:M 2 ...)))]
+            "..."
+            "...")
+
+     Similarly, a pattern for a "NAND" instruction should be written
+
+          (define_insn ""
+            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
+                  (ior:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
+                               (not:M (match_operand:M 2 ...))))]
+            "..."
+            "...")
+
+     In both cases, it is not necessary to include patterns for the many
+     logically equivalent RTL expressions.
+
+   * The only possible RTL expressions involving both bitwise
+     exclusive-or and bitwise negation are `(xor:M X Y)' and `(not:M
+     (xor:M X Y))'.
+
+   * The sum of three items, one of which is a constant, will only
+     appear in the form
+
+          (plus:M (plus:M X Y) CONSTANT)
+
+   * On machines that do not use `cc0', `(compare X (const_int 0))'
+     will be converted to X.
+
+   * Equality comparisons of a group of bits (usually a single bit)
+     with zero will be written using `zero_extract' rather than the
+     equivalent `and' or `sign_extract' operations.

+
+Machine-Specific Peephole Optimizers
+====================================
+
+   In addition to instruction patterns the `md' file may contain
+definitions of machine-specific peephole optimizations.
+
+   The combiner does not notice certain peephole optimizations when the
+data flow in the program does not suggest that it should try them.  For
+example, sometimes two consecutive insns related in purpose can be
+combined even though the second one does not appear to use a register
+computed in the first one.  A machine-specific peephole optimizer can
+detect such opportunities.
+
+   A definition looks like this:
+
+     (define_peephole
+       [INSN-PATTERN-1
+        INSN-PATTERN-2
+        ...]
+       "CONDITION"
+       "TEMPLATE"
+       "OPTIONAL INSN-ATTRIBUTES")
+
+The last string operand may be omitted if you are not using any
+machine-specific information in this machine description.  If present,
+it must obey the same rules as in a `define_insn'.
+
+   In this skeleton, INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on are patterns to match
+consecutive insns.  The optimization applies to a sequence of insns when
+INSN-PATTERN-1 matches the first one, INSN-PATTERN-2 matches the next,
+and so on.
+
+   Each of the insns matched by a peephole must also match a
+`define_insn'.  Peepholes are checked only at the last stage just
+before code generation, and only optionally.  Therefore, any insn which
+would match a peephole but no `define_insn' will cause a crash in code
+generation in an unoptimized compilation, or at various optimization
+stages.
+
+   The operands of the insns are matched with `match_operands',
+`match_operator', and `match_dup', as usual.  What is not usual is that
+the operand numbers apply to all the insn patterns in the definition.
+So, you can check for identical operands in two insns by using
+`match_operand' in one insn and `match_dup' in the other.
+
+   The operand constraints used in `match_operand' patterns do not have
+any direct effect on the applicability of the peephole, but they will
+be validated afterward, so make sure your constraints are general enough
+to apply whenever the peephole matches.  If the peephole matches but
+the constraints are not satisfied, the compiler will crash.
+
+   It is safe to omit constraints in all the operands of the peephole;
+or you can write constraints which serve as a double-check on the
+criteria previously tested.
+
+   Once a sequence of insns matches the patterns, the CONDITION is
+checked.  This is a C expression which makes the final decision whether
+to perform the optimization (we do so if the expression is nonzero).  If
+CONDITION is omitted (in other words, the string is empty) then the
+optimization is applied to every sequence of insns that matches the
+patterns.
+
+   The defined peephole optimizations are applied after register
+allocation is complete.  Therefore, the peephole definition can check
+which operands have ended up in which kinds of registers, just by
+looking at the operands.
+
+   The way to refer to the operands in CONDITION is to write
+`operands[I]' for operand number I (as matched by `(match_operand I
+...)').  Use the variable `insn' to refer to the last of the insns
+being matched; use `prev_active_insn' to find the preceding insns.
+
+   When optimizing computations with intermediate results, you can use
+CONDITION to match only when the intermediate results are not used
+elsewhere.  Use the C expression `dead_or_set_p (INSN, OP)', where INSN
+is the insn in which you expect the value to be used for the last time
+(from the value of `insn', together with use of `prev_nonnote_insn'),
+and OP is the intermediate value (from `operands[I]').
+
+   Applying the optimization means replacing the sequence of insns with
+one new insn.  The TEMPLATE controls ultimate output of assembler code
+for this combined insn.  It works exactly like the template of a
+`define_insn'.  Operand numbers in this template are the same ones used
+in matching the original sequence of insns.
+
+   The result of a defined peephole optimizer does not need to match
+any of the insn patterns in the machine description; it does not even
+have an opportunity to match them.  The peephole optimizer definition
+itself serves as the insn pattern to control how the insn is output.
+
+   Defined peephole optimizers are run as assembler code is being
+output, so the insns they produce are never combined or rearranged in
+any way.
+
+   Here is an example, taken from the 68000 machine description:
+
+     (define_peephole
+       [(set (reg:SI 15) (plus:SI (reg:SI 15) (const_int 4)))
+        (set (match_operand:DF 0 "register_operand" "=f")
+             (match_operand:DF 1 "register_operand" "ad"))]
+       "FP_REG_P (operands[0]) && ! FP_REG_P (operands[1])"
+       "*
+     {
+       rtx xoperands[2];
+       xoperands[1] = gen_rtx (REG, SImode, REGNO (operands[1]) + 1);
+     #ifdef MOTOROLA
+       output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,(sp)\", xoperands);
+       output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,-(sp)\", operands);
+       return \"fmove.d (sp)+,%0\";
+     #else
+       output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@\", xoperands);
+       output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@-\", operands);
+       return \"fmoved sp@+,%0\";
+     #endif
+     }
+     ")
+
+   The effect of this optimization is to change
+
+     jbsr _foobar
+     addql #4,sp
+     movel d1,sp@-
+     movel d0,sp@-
+     fmoved sp@+,fp0
+
+into
+
+     jbsr _foobar
+     movel d1,sp@
+     movel d0,sp@-
+     fmoved sp@+,fp0
+
+   INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on look *almost* like the second operand of
+`define_insn'.  There is one important difference: the second operand
+of `define_insn' consists of one or more RTX's enclosed in square
+brackets.  Usually, there is only one: then the same action can be
+written as an element of a `define_peephole'.  But when there are
+multiple actions in a `define_insn', they are implicitly enclosed in a
+`parallel'.  Then you must explicitly write the `parallel', and the
+square brackets within it, in the `define_peephole'.  Thus, if an insn
+pattern looks like this,
+
+     (define_insn "divmodsi4"
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
+             (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
+                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
+        (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
+             (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))]
+       "TARGET_68020"
+       "divsl%.l %2,%3:%0")
+
+then the way to mention this insn in a peephole is as follows:
+
+     (define_peephole
+       [...
+        (parallel
+         [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
+               (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
+                       (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
+          (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
+               (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))])
+        ...]
+       ...)

+
+Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation
+==========================================
+
+   On some target machines, some standard pattern names for RTL
+generation cannot be handled with single insn, but a sequence of RTL
+insns can represent them.  For these target machines, you can write a
+`define_expand' to specify how to generate the sequence of RTL.
+
+   A `define_expand' is an RTL expression that looks almost like a
+`define_insn'; but, unlike the latter, a `define_expand' is used only
+for RTL generation and it can produce more than one RTL insn.
+
+   A `define_expand' RTX has four operands:
+
+   * The name.  Each `define_expand' must have a name, since the only
+     use for it is to refer to it by name.
+
+   * The RTL template.  This is just like the RTL template for a
+     `define_peephole' in that it is a vector of RTL expressions each
+     being one insn.
+
+   * The condition, a string containing a C expression.  This
+     expression is used to express how the availability of this pattern
+     depends on subclasses of target machine, selected by command-line
+     options when GNU CC is run.  This is just like the condition of a
+     `define_insn' that has a standard name.  Therefore, the condition
+     (if present) may not depend on the data in the insn being matched,
+     but only the target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to
+     test these conditions during initialization in order to learn
+     exactly which named instructions are available in a particular run.
+
+   * The preparation statements, a string containing zero or more C
+     statements which are to be executed before RTL code is generated
+     from the RTL template.
+
+     Usually these statements prepare temporary registers for use as
+     internal operands in the RTL template, but they can also generate
+     RTL insns directly by calling routines such as `emit_insn', etc.
+     Any such insns precede the ones that come from the RTL template.
+
+   Every RTL insn emitted by a `define_expand' must match some
+`define_insn' in the machine description.  Otherwise, the compiler will
+crash when trying to generate code for the insn or trying to optimize
+it.
+
+   The RTL template, in addition to controlling generation of RTL insns,
+also describes the operands that need to be specified when this pattern
+is used.  In particular, it gives a predicate for each operand.
+
+   A true operand, which needs to be specified in order to generate RTL
+from the pattern, should be described with a `match_operand' in its
+first occurrence in the RTL template.  This enters information on the
+operand's predicate into the tables that record such things.  GNU CC
+uses the information to preload the operand into a register if that is
+required for valid RTL code.  If the operand is referred to more than
+once, subsequent references should use `match_dup'.
+
+   The RTL template may also refer to internal "operands" which are
+temporary registers or labels used only within the sequence made by the
+`define_expand'.  Internal operands are substituted into the RTL
+template with `match_dup', never with `match_operand'.  The values of
+the internal operands are not passed in as arguments by the compiler
+when it requests use of this pattern.  Instead, they are computed
+within the pattern, in the preparation statements.  These statements
+compute the values and store them into the appropriate elements of
+`operands' so that `match_dup' can find them.
+
+   There are two special macros defined for use in the preparation
+statements: `DONE' and `FAIL'.  Use them with a following semicolon, as
+a statement.
+
+`DONE'
+     Use the `DONE' macro to end RTL generation for the pattern.  The
+     only RTL insns resulting from the pattern on this occasion will be
+     those already emitted by explicit calls to `emit_insn' within the
+     preparation statements; the RTL template will not be generated.
+
+`FAIL'
+     Make the pattern fail on this occasion.  When a pattern fails, it
+     means that the pattern was not truly available.  The calling
+     routines in the compiler will try other strategies for code
+     generation using other patterns.
+
+     Failure is currently supported only for binary (addition,
+     multiplication, shifting, etc.) and bitfield (`extv', `extzv', and
+     `insv') operations.
+
+   Here is an example, the definition of left-shift for the SPUR chip:
+
+     (define_expand "ashlsi3"
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
+             (ashift:SI
+
+     (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
+               (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "")))]
+       ""
+       "
+
+     {
+       if (GET_CODE (operands[2]) != CONST_INT
+           || (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) > 3)
+         FAIL;
+     }")
+
+This example uses `define_expand' so that it can generate an RTL insn
+for shifting when the shift-count is in the supported range of 0 to 3
+but fail in other cases where machine insns aren't available.  When it
+fails, the compiler tries another strategy using different patterns
+(such as, a library call).
+
+   If the compiler were able to handle nontrivial condition-strings in
+patterns with names, then it would be possible to use a `define_insn'
+in that case.  Here is another case (zero-extension on the 68000) which
+makes more use of the power of `define_expand':
+
+     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "")
+             (const_int 0))
+        (set (strict_low_part
+               (subreg:HI
+                 (match_dup 0)
+                 0))
+             (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
+       ""
+       "operands[1] = make_safe_from (operands[1], operands[0]);")
+
+Here two RTL insns are generated, one to clear the entire output operand
+and the other to copy the input operand into its low half.  This
+sequence is incorrect if the input operand refers to [the old value of]
+the output operand, so the preparation statement makes sure this isn't
+so.  The function `make_safe_from' copies the `operands[1]' into a
+temporary register if it refers to `operands[0]'.  It does this by
+emitting another RTL insn.
+
+   Finally, a third example shows the use of an internal operand.
+Zero-extension on the SPUR chip is done by `and'-ing the result against
+a halfword mask.  But this mask cannot be represented by a `const_int'
+because the constant value is too large to be legitimate on this
+machine.  So it must be copied into a register with `force_reg' and
+then the register used in the `and'.
+
+     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
+             (and:SI (subreg:SI
+                       (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "")

+       ""
+       "operands[2]
+          = force_reg (SImode, GEN_INT (65535)); ")
+
+   *Note:* If the `define_expand' is used to serve a standard binary or
+unary arithmetic operation or a bitfield operation, then the last insn
+it generates must not be a `code_label', `barrier' or `note'.  It must
+be an `insn', `jump_insn' or `call_insn'.  If you don't need a real insn
+at the end, emit an insn to copy the result of the operation into
+itself.  Such an insn will generate no code, but it can avoid problems
+in the compiler.

+
+Defining How to Split Instructions
+==================================
+
+   There are two cases where you should specify how to split a pattern
+into multiple insns.  On machines that have instructions requiring delay
+slots (*note Delay Slots::.) or that have instructions whose output is
+not available for multiple cycles (*note Function Units::.), the
+compiler phases that optimize these cases need to be able to move insns
+into one-instruction delay slots.  However, some insns may generate
+more than one machine instruction.  These insns cannot be placed into a
+delay slot.
+
+   Often you can rewrite the single insn as a list of individual insns,
+each corresponding to one machine instruction.  The disadvantage of
+doing so is that it will cause the compilation to be slower and require
+more space.  If the resulting insns are too complex, it may also
+suppress some optimizations.  The compiler splits the insn if there is a
+reason to believe that it might improve instruction or delay slot
+scheduling.
+
+   The insn combiner phase also splits putative insns.  If three insns
+are merged into one insn with a complex expression that cannot be
+matched by some `define_insn' pattern, the combiner phase attempts to
+split the complex pattern into two insns that are recognized.  Usually
+it can break the complex pattern into two patterns by splitting out some
+subexpression.  However, in some other cases, such as performing an
+addition of a large constant in two insns on a RISC machine, the way to
+split the addition into two insns is machine-dependent.
+
+   The `define_split' definition tells the compiler how to split a
+complex insn into several simpler insns.  It looks like this:
+
+     (define_split
+       [INSN-PATTERN]
+       "CONDITION"
+       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
+        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
+        ...]
+       "PREPARATION STATEMENTS")
+
+   INSN-PATTERN is a pattern that needs to be split and CONDITION is
+the final condition to be tested, as in a `define_insn'.  When an insn
+matching INSN-PATTERN and satisfying CONDITION is found, it is replaced
+in the insn list with the insns given by NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1,
+NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2, etc.
+
+   The PREPARATION STATEMENTS are similar to those statements that are
+specified for `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.)  and are
+executed before the new RTL is generated to prepare for the generated
+code or emit some insns whose pattern is not fixed.  Unlike those in
+`define_expand', however, these statements must not generate any new
+pseudo-registers.  Once reload has completed, they also must not
+allocate any space in the stack frame.
+
+   Patterns are matched against INSN-PATTERN in two different
+circumstances.  If an insn needs to be split for delay slot scheduling
+or insn scheduling, the insn is already known to be valid, which means
+that it must have been matched by some `define_insn' and, if
+`reload_completed' is non-zero, is known to satisfy the constraints of
+that `define_insn'.  In that case, the new insn patterns must also be
+insns that are matched by some `define_insn' and, if `reload_completed'
+is non-zero, must also satisfy the constraints of those definitions.
+
+   As an example of this usage of `define_split', consider the following
+example from `a29k.md', which splits a `sign_extend' from `HImode' to
+`SImode' into a pair of shift insns:
+
+     (define_split
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
+             (sign_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")))]
+       ""
+       [(set (match_dup 0)
+             (ashift:SI (match_dup 1)
+                        (const_int 16)))
+        (set (match_dup 0)
+             (ashiftrt:SI (match_dup 0)
+                          (const_int 16)))]
+       "
+     { operands[1] = gen_lowpart (SImode, operands[1]); }")
+
+   When the combiner phase tries to split an insn pattern, it is always
+the case that the pattern is *not* matched by any `define_insn'.  The
+combiner pass first tries to split a single `set' expression and then
+the same `set' expression inside a `parallel', but followed by a
+`clobber' of a pseudo-reg to use as a scratch register.  In these
+cases, the combiner expects exactly two new insn patterns to be
+generated.  It will verify that these patterns match some `define_insn'
+definitions, so you need not do this test in the `define_split' (of
+course, there is no point in writing a `define_split' that will never
+produce insns that match).
+
+   Here is an example of this use of `define_split', taken from
+`rs6000.md':
+
+     (define_split
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
+             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
+                      (match_operand:SI 2 "non_add_cint_operand" "")))]
+       ""
+       [(set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 3)))
+        (set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4)))]
+     "
+     {
+       int low = INTVAL (operands[2]) & 0xffff;
+       int high = (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) >> 16;
+     
+       if (low & 0x8000)
+         high++, low |= 0xffff0000;
+     
+       operands[3] = GEN_INT (high << 16);
+       operands[4] = GEN_INT (low);
+     }")
+
+   Here the predicate `non_add_cint_operand' matches any `const_int'
+that is *not* a valid operand of a single add insn.  The add with the
+smaller displacement is written so that it can be substituted into the
+address of a subsequent operation.
+
+   An example that uses a scratch register, from the same file,
+generates an equality comparison of a register and a large constant:
+
+     (define_split
+       [(set (match_operand:CC 0 "cc_reg_operand" "")
+             (compare:CC (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
+                         (match_operand:SI 2 "non_short_cint_operand" "")))
+        (clobber (match_operand:SI 3 "gen_reg_operand" ""))]
+       "find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)
+        && (GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == EQ
+            || GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == NE)"
+       [(set (match_dup 3) (xor:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 4)))
+        (set (match_dup 0) (compare:CC (match_dup 3) (match_dup 5)))]
+       "
+     {
+       /* Get the constant we are comparing against, C, and see what it
+          looks like sign-extended to 16 bits.  Then see what constant
+          could be XOR'ed with C to get the sign-extended value.  */
+     
+       int c = INTVAL (operands[2]);
+       int sextc = (c << 16) >> 16;
+       int xorv = c ^ sextc;
+     
+       operands[4] = GEN_INT (xorv);
+       operands[5] = GEN_INT (sextc);
+     }")
+
+   To avoid confusion, don't write a single `define_split' that accepts
+some insns that match some `define_insn' as well as some insns that
+don't.  Instead, write two separate `define_split' definitions, one for
+the insns that are valid and one for the insns that are not valid.

+Instruction Attributes
+======================
+
+   In addition to describing the instruction supported by the target
+machine, the `md' file also defines a group of "attributes" and a set of
+values for each.  Every generated insn is assigned a value for each
+attribute.  One possible attribute would be the effect that the insn
+has on the machine's condition code.  This attribute can then be used
+by `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to track the condition codes.

+
+Defining Attributes and their Values
+------------------------------------
+
+   The `define_attr' expression is used to define each attribute
+required by the target machine.  It looks like:
+
+     (define_attr NAME LIST-OF-VALUES DEFAULT)
+
+   NAME is a string specifying the name of the attribute being defined.
+
+   LIST-OF-VALUES is either a string that specifies a comma-separated
+list of values that can be assigned to the attribute, or a null string
+to indicate that the attribute takes numeric values.
+
+   DEFAULT is an attribute expression that gives the value of this
+attribute for insns that match patterns whose definition does not
+include an explicit value for this attribute.  *Note Attr Example::,
+for more information on the handling of defaults.  *Note Constant
+Attributes::, for information on attributes that do not depend on any
+particular insn.
+
+   For each defined attribute, a number of definitions are written to
+the `insn-attr.h' file.  For cases where an explicit set of values is
+specified for an attribute, the following are defined:
+
+   * A `#define' is written for the symbol `HAVE_ATTR_NAME'.
+
+   * An enumeral class is defined for `attr_NAME' with elements of the
+     form `UPPER-NAME_UPPER-VALUE' where the attribute name and value
+     are first converted to upper case.
+
+   * A function `get_attr_NAME' is defined that is passed an insn and
+     returns the attribute value for that insn.
+
+   For example, if the following is present in the `md' file:
+
+     (define_attr "type" "branch,fp,load,store,arith" ...)
+
+the following lines will be written to the file `insn-attr.h'.
+
+     #define HAVE_ATTR_type
+     enum attr_type {TYPE_BRANCH, TYPE_FP, TYPE_LOAD,
+                      TYPE_STORE, TYPE_ARITH};
+     extern enum attr_type get_attr_type ();
+
+   If the attribute takes numeric values, no `enum' type will be
+defined and the function to obtain the attribute's value will return
+`int'.

+
+Attribute Expressions
+---------------------
+
+   RTL expressions used to define attributes use the codes described
+above plus a few specific to attribute definitions, to be discussed
+below.  Attribute value expressions must have one of the following
+forms:
+
+`(const_int I)'
+     The integer I specifies the value of a numeric attribute.  I must
+     be non-negative.
+
+     The value of a numeric attribute can be specified either with a
+     `const_int', or as an integer represented as a string in
+     `const_string', `eq_attr' (see below), `attr', `symbol_ref',
+     simple arithmetic expressions, and `set_attr' overrides on
+     specific instructions (*note Tagging Insns::.).
+
+`(const_string VALUE)'
+     The string VALUE specifies a constant attribute value.  If VALUE
+     is specified as `"*"', it means that the default value of the
+     attribute is to be used for the insn containing this expression.
+     `"*"' obviously cannot be used in the DEFAULT expression of a
+     `define_attr'.
+
+     If the attribute whose value is being specified is numeric, VALUE
+     must be a string containing a non-negative integer (normally
+     `const_int' would be used in this case).  Otherwise, it must
+     contain one of the valid values for the attribute.
+
+`(if_then_else TEST TRUE-VALUE FALSE-VALUE)'
+     TEST specifies an attribute test, whose format is defined below.
+     The value of this expression is TRUE-VALUE if TEST is true,
+     otherwise it is FALSE-VALUE.
+
+`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 ...] DEFAULT)'
+     The first operand of this expression is a vector containing an even
+     number of expressions and consisting of pairs of TEST and VALUE
+     expressions.  The value of the `cond' expression is that of the
+     VALUE corresponding to the first true TEST expression.  If none of
+     the TEST expressions are true, the value of the `cond' expression
+     is that of the DEFAULT expression.
+
+   TEST expressions can have one of the following forms:
+
+`(const_int I)'
+     This test is true if I is non-zero and false otherwise.
+
+`(not TEST)'
+`(ior TEST1 TEST2)'
+`(and TEST1 TEST2)'
+     These tests are true if the indicated logical function is true.
+
+`(match_operand:M N PRED CONSTRAINTS)'
+     This test is true if operand N of the insn whose attribute value
+     is being determined has mode M (this part of the test is ignored
+     if M is `VOIDmode') and the function specified by the string PRED
+     returns a non-zero value when passed operand N and mode M (this
+     part of the test is ignored if PRED is the null string).
+
+     The CONSTRAINTS operand is ignored and should be the null string.
+
+`(le ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(leu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(lt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(ltu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(gt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(gtu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(ge ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(geu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(ne ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+`(eq ARITH1 ARITH2)'
+     These tests are true if the indicated comparison of the two
+     arithmetic expressions is true.  Arithmetic expressions are formed
+     with `plus', `minus', `mult', `div', `mod', `abs', `neg', `and',
+     `ior', `xor', `not', `ashift', `lshiftrt', and `ashiftrt'
+     expressions.
+
+     `const_int' and `symbol_ref' are always valid terms (*note Insn
+     Lengths::.,for additional forms).  `symbol_ref' is a string
+     denoting a C expression that yields an `int' when evaluated by the
+     `get_attr_...' routine.  It should normally be a global variable.
+
+`(eq_attr NAME VALUE)'
+     NAME is a string specifying the name of an attribute.
+
+     VALUE is a string that is either a valid value for attribute NAME,
+     a comma-separated list of values, or `!' followed by a value or
+     list.  If VALUE does not begin with a `!', this test is true if
+     the value of the NAME attribute of the current insn is in the list
+     specified by VALUE.  If VALUE begins with a `!', this test is true
+     if the attribute's value is *not* in the specified list.
+
+     For example,
+
+          (eq_attr "type" "load,store")
+
+     is equivalent to
+
+          (ior (eq_attr "type" "load") (eq_attr "type" "store"))
+
+     If NAME specifies an attribute of `alternative', it refers to the
+     value of the compiler variable `which_alternative' (*note Output
+     Statement::.) and the values must be small integers.  For example,
+
+          (eq_attr "alternative" "2,3")
+
+     is equivalent to
+
+          (ior (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 2))
+               (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 3)))
+
+     Note that, for most attributes, an `eq_attr' test is simplified in
+     cases where the value of the attribute being tested is known for
+     all insns matching a particular pattern.  This is by far the most
+     common case.
+
+`(attr_flag NAME)'
+     The value of an `attr_flag' expression is true if the flag
+     specified by NAME is true for the `insn' currently being scheduled.
+
+     NAME is a string specifying one of a fixed set of flags to test.
+     Test the flags `forward' and `backward' to determine the direction
+     of a conditional branch.  Test the flags `very_likely', `likely',
+     `very_unlikely', and `unlikely' to determine if a conditional
+     branch is expected to be taken.
+
+     If the `very_likely' flag is true, then the `likely' flag is also
+     true.  Likewise for the `very_unlikely' and `unlikely' flags.
+
+     This example describes a conditional branch delay slot which can
+     be nullified for forward branches that are taken (annul-true) or
+     for backward branches which are not taken (annul-false).
+
+          (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "cbranch")
+            [(eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
+             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
+                  (attr_flag "forward"))
+             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
+                  (attr_flag "backward"))])
+
+     The `forward' and `backward' flags are false if the current `insn'
+     being scheduled is not a conditional branch.
+
+     The `very_likely' and `likely' flags are true if the `insn' being
+     scheduled is not a conditional branch.  The `very_unlikely' and
+     `unlikely' flags are false if the `insn' being scheduled is not a
+     conditional branch.
+
+     `attr_flag' is only used during delay slot scheduling and has no
+     meaning to other passes of the compiler.
+
+`(attr NAME)'
+     The value of another attribute is returned.  This is most useful
+     for numeric attributes, as `eq_attr' and `attr_flag' produce more
+     efficient code for non-numeric attributes.

+
+Assigning Attribute Values to Insns
+-----------------------------------
+
+   The value assigned to an attribute of an insn is primarily
+determined by which pattern is matched by that insn (or which
+`define_peephole' generated it).  Every `define_insn' and
+`define_peephole' can have an optional last argument to specify the
+values of attributes for matching insns.  The value of any attribute
+not specified in a particular insn is set to the default value for that
+attribute, as specified in its `define_attr'.  Extensive use of default
+values for attributes permits the specification of the values for only
+one or two attributes in the definition of most insn patterns, as seen
+in the example in the next section.
+
+   The optional last argument of `define_insn' and `define_peephole' is
+a vector of expressions, each of which defines the value for a single
+attribute.  The most general way of assigning an attribute's value is
+to use a `set' expression whose first operand is an `attr' expression
+giving the name of the attribute being set.  The second operand of the
+`set' is an attribute expression (*note Expressions::.) giving the
+value of the attribute.
+
+   When the attribute value depends on the `alternative' attribute
+(i.e., which is the applicable alternative in the constraint of the
+insn), the `set_attr_alternative' expression can be used.  It allows
+the specification of a vector of attribute expressions, one for each
+alternative.
+
+   When the generality of arbitrary attribute expressions is not
+required, the simpler `set_attr' expression can be used, which allows
+specifying a string giving either a single attribute value or a list of
+attribute values, one for each alternative.
+
+   The form of each of the above specifications is shown below.  In
+each case, NAME is a string specifying the attribute to be set.
+
+`(set_attr NAME VALUE-STRING)'
+     VALUE-STRING is either a string giving the desired attribute value,
+     or a string containing a comma-separated list giving the values for
+     succeeding alternatives.  The number of elements must match the
+     number of alternatives in the constraint of the insn pattern.
+
+     Note that it may be useful to specify `*' for some alternative, in
+     which case the attribute will assume its default value for insns
+     matching that alternative.
+
+`(set_attr_alternative NAME [VALUE1 VALUE2 ...])'
+     Depending on the alternative of the insn, the value will be one of
+     the specified values.  This is a shorthand for using a `cond' with
+     tests on the `alternative' attribute.
+
+`(set (attr NAME) VALUE)'
+     The first operand of this `set' must be the special RTL expression
+     `attr', whose sole operand is a string giving the name of the
+     attribute being set.  VALUE is the value of the attribute.
+
+   The following shows three different ways of representing the same
+attribute value specification:
+
+     (set_attr "type" "load,store,arith")
+     
+     (set_attr_alternative "type"
+                           [(const_string "load") (const_string "store")
+                            (const_string "arith")])
+     
+     (set (attr "type")
+          (cond [(eq_attr "alternative" "1") (const_string "load")
+                 (eq_attr "alternative" "2") (const_string "store")]
+                (const_string "arith")))
+
+   The `define_asm_attributes' expression provides a mechanism to
+specify the attributes assigned to insns produced from an `asm'
+statement.  It has the form:
+
+     (define_asm_attributes [ATTR-SETS])
+
+where ATTR-SETS is specified the same as for both the `define_insn' and
+the `define_peephole' expressions.
+
+   These values will typically be the "worst case" attribute values.
+For example, they might indicate that the condition code will be
+clobbered.
+
+   A specification for a `length' attribute is handled specially.  The
+way to compute the length of an `asm' insn is to multiply the length
+specified in the expression `define_asm_attributes' by the number of
+machine instructions specified in the `asm' statement, determined by
+counting the number of semicolons and newlines in the string.
+Therefore, the value of the `length' attribute specified in a
+`define_asm_attributes' should be the maximum possible length of a
+single machine instruction.

+-----------------------------------
+
+   The judicious use of defaulting is important in the efficient use of
+insn attributes.  Typically, insns are divided into "types" and an
+attribute, customarily called `type', is used to represent this value.
+This attribute is normally used only to define the default value for
+other attributes.  An example will clarify this usage.
+
+   Assume we have a RISC machine with a condition code and in which only
+full-word operations are performed in registers.  Let us assume that we
+can divide all insns into loads, stores, (integer) arithmetic
+operations, floating point operations, and branches.
+
+   Here we will concern ourselves with determining the effect of an
+insn on the condition code and will limit ourselves to the following
+possible effects:  The condition code can be set unpredictably
+(clobbered), not be changed, be set to agree with the results of the
+operation, or only changed if the item previously set into the
+condition code has been modified.
+
+   Here is part of a sample `md' file for such a machine:
+
+     (define_attr "type" "load,store,arith,fp,branch" (const_string "arith"))
+     
+     (define_attr "cc" "clobber,unchanged,set,change0"
+                  (cond [(eq_attr "type" "load")
+                             (const_string "change0")
+                         (eq_attr "type" "store,branch")
+                             (const_string "unchanged")
+                         (eq_attr "type" "arith")
+                             (if_then_else (match_operand:SI 0 "" "")
+                                           (const_string "set")
+                                           (const_string "clobber"))]
+                        (const_string "clobber")))
+     
+     (define_insn ""
+       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,r,m")
+             (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r,m,r"))]
+       ""
+       "@
+        move %0,%1
+        load %0,%1
+        store %0,%1"
+       [(set_attr "type" "arith,load,store")])
+
+   Note that we assume in the above example that arithmetic operations
+performed on quantities smaller than a machine word clobber the
+condition code since they will set the condition code to a value
+corresponding to the full-word result.

+
+Computing the Length of an Insn
+-------------------------------
+
+   For many machines, multiple types of branch instructions are
+provided, each for different length branch displacements.  In most
+cases, the assembler will choose the correct instruction to use.
+However, when the assembler cannot do so, GCC can when a special
+attribute, the `length' attribute, is defined.  This attribute must be
+defined to have numeric values by specifying a null string in its
+`define_attr'.
+
+   In the case of the `length' attribute, two additional forms of
+arithmetic terms are allowed in test expressions:
+
+`(match_dup N)'
+     This refers to the address of operand N of the current insn, which
+     must be a `label_ref'.
+
+`(pc)'
+     This refers to the address of the *current* insn.  It might have
+     been more consistent with other usage to make this the address of
+     the *next* insn but this would be confusing because the length of
+     the current insn is to be computed.
+
+   For normal insns, the length will be determined by value of the
+`length' attribute.  In the case of `addr_vec' and `addr_diff_vec' insn
+patterns, the length is computed as the number of vectors multiplied by
+the size of each vector.
+
+   Lengths are measured in addressable storage units (bytes).
+
+   The following macros can be used to refine the length computation:
+
+`FIRST_INSN_ADDRESS'
+     When the `length' insn attribute is used, this macro specifies the
+     value to be assigned to the address of the first insn in a
+     function.  If not specified, 0 is used.
+
+`ADJUST_INSN_LENGTH (INSN, LENGTH)'
+     If defined, modifies the length assigned to instruction INSN as a
+     function of the context in which it is used.  LENGTH is an lvalue
+     that contains the initially computed length of the insn and should
+     be updated with the correct length of the insn.
+
+     This macro will normally not be required.  A case in which it is
+     required is the ROMP.  On this machine, the size of an `addr_vec'
+     insn must be increased by two to compensate for the fact that
+     alignment may be required.
+
+   The routine that returns `get_attr_length' (the value of the
+`length' attribute) can be used by the output routine to determine the
+form of the branch instruction to be written, as the example below
+illustrates.
+
+   As an example of the specification of variable-length branches,
+consider the IBM 360.  If we adopt the convention that a register will
+be set to the starting address of a function, we can jump to labels
+within 4k of the start using a four-byte instruction.  Otherwise, we
+need a six-byte sequence to load the address from memory and then
+branch to it.
+
+   On such a machine, a pattern for a branch instruction might be
+specified as follows:
+
+     (define_insn "jump"
+       [(set (pc)
+             (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" "")))]
+       ""
+       "*
+     {
+        return (get_attr_length (insn) == 4
+                ? \"b %l0\" : \"l r15,=a(%l0); br r15\");
+     }"
+       [(set (attr "length") (if_then_else (lt (match_dup 0) (const_int 4096))
+                                           (const_int 4)
+                                           (const_int 6)))])
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Constant Attributes,  Next: Delay Slots,  Prev: Insn Lengths,  Up: Insn Attributes
+
+Constant Attributes
+-------------------
+
+   A special form of `define_attr', where the expression for the
+default value is a `const' expression, indicates an attribute that is
+constant for a given run of the compiler.  Constant attributes may be
+used to specify which variety of processor is used.  For example,
+
+     (define_attr "cpu" "m88100,m88110,m88000"
+      (const
+       (cond [(symbol_ref "TARGET_88100") (const_string "m88100")
+              (symbol_ref "TARGET_88110") (const_string "m88110")]
+             (const_string "m88000"))))
+     
+     (define_attr "memory" "fast,slow"
+      (const
+       (if_then_else (symbol_ref "TARGET_FAST_MEM")
+                     (const_string "fast")
+                     (const_string "slow"))))
+
+   The routine generated for constant attributes has no parameters as it
+does not depend on any particular insn.  RTL expressions used to define
+the value of a constant attribute may use the `symbol_ref' form, but
+may not use either the `match_operand' form or `eq_attr' forms
+involving insn attributes.
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Delay Slots,  Next: Function Units,  Prev: Constant Attributes,  Up: Insn Attributes
+
+Delay Slot Scheduling
+---------------------
+
+   The insn attribute mechanism can be used to specify the requirements
+for delay slots, if any, on a target machine.  An instruction is said to
+require a "delay slot" if some instructions that are physically after
+the instruction are executed as if they were located before it.
+Classic examples are branch and call instructions, which often execute
+the following instruction before the branch or call is performed.
+
+   On some machines, conditional branch instructions can optionally
+"annul" instructions in the delay slot.  This means that the
+instruction will not be executed for certain branch outcomes.  Both
+instructions that annul if the branch is true and instructions that
+annul if the branch is false are supported.
+
+   Delay slot scheduling differs from instruction scheduling in that
+determining whether an instruction needs a delay slot is dependent only
+on the type of instruction being generated, not on data flow between the
+instructions.  See the next section for a discussion of data-dependent
+instruction scheduling.
+
+   The requirement of an insn needing one or more delay slots is
+indicated via the `define_delay' expression.  It has the following form:
+
+     (define_delay TEST
+                   [DELAY-1 ANNUL-TRUE-1 ANNUL-FALSE-1
+                    DELAY-2 ANNUL-TRUE-2 ANNUL-FALSE-2
+                    ...])
+
+   TEST is an attribute test that indicates whether this `define_delay'
+applies to a particular insn.  If so, the number of required delay
+slots is determined by the length of the vector specified as the second
+argument.  An insn placed in delay slot N must satisfy attribute test
+DELAY-N.  ANNUL-TRUE-N is an attribute test that specifies which insns
+may be annulled if the branch is true.  Similarly, ANNUL-FALSE-N
+specifies which insns in the delay slot may be annulled if the branch
+is false.  If annulling is not supported for that delay slot, `(nil)'
+should be coded.
+
+   For example, in the common case where branch and call insns require
+a single delay slot, which may contain any insn other than a branch or
+call, the following would be placed in the `md' file:
+
+     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch,call")
+                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])
+
+   Multiple `define_delay' expressions may be specified.  In this case,
+each such expression specifies different delay slot requirements and
+there must be no insn for which tests in two `define_delay' expressions
+are both true.
+
+   For example, if we have a machine that requires one delay slot for
+branches but two for calls,  no delay slot can contain a branch or call
+insn, and any valid insn in the delay slot for the branch can be
+annulled if the branch is true, we might represent this as follows:
+
+     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch")
+        [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
+         (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
+         (nil)])
+     
+     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "call")
+                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)
+                    (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

+
+Specifying Function Units
+-------------------------
+
+   On most RISC machines, there are instructions whose results are not
+available for a specific number of cycles.  Common cases are
+instructions that load data from memory.  On many machines, a pipeline
+stall will result if the data is referenced too soon after the load
+instruction.
+
+   In addition, many newer microprocessors have multiple function
+units, usually one for integer and one for floating point, and often
+will incur pipeline stalls when a result that is needed is not yet
+ready.
+
+   The descriptions in this section allow the specification of how much
+time must elapse between the execution of an instruction and the time
+when its result is used.  It also allows specification of when the
+execution of an instruction will delay execution of similar instructions
+due to function unit conflicts.
+
+   For the purposes of the specifications in this section, a machine is
+divided into "function units", each of which execute a specific class
+of instructions in first-in-first-out order.  Function units that
+accept one instruction each cycle and allow a result to be used in the
+succeeding instruction (usually via forwarding) need not be specified.
+Classic RISC microprocessors will normally have a single function unit,
+which we can call `memory'.  The newer "superscalar" processors will
+often have function units for floating point operations, usually at
+least a floating point adder and multiplier.
+
+   Each usage of a function units by a class of insns is specified with
+a `define_function_unit' expression, which looks like this:
+
+     (define_function_unit NAME MULTIPLICITY SIMULTANEITY
+                           TEST READY-DELAY ISSUE-DELAY
+                          [CONFLICT-LIST])
+
+   NAME is a string giving the name of the function unit.
+
+   MULTIPLICITY is an integer specifying the number of identical units
+in the processor.  If more than one unit is specified, they will be
+scheduled independently.  Only truly independent units should be
+counted; a pipelined unit should be specified as a single unit.  (The
+only common example of a machine that has multiple function units for a
+single instruction class that are truly independent and not pipelined
+are the two multiply and two increment units of the CDC 6600.)
+
+   SIMULTANEITY specifies the maximum number of insns that can be
+executing in each instance of the function unit simultaneously or zero
+if the unit is pipelined and has no limit.
+
+   All `define_function_unit' definitions referring to function unit
+NAME must have the same name and values for MULTIPLICITY and
+SIMULTANEITY.
+
+   TEST is an attribute test that selects the insns we are describing
+in this definition.  Note that an insn may use more than one function
+unit and a function unit may be specified in more than one
+`define_function_unit'.
+
+   READY-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
+which the result of the instruction can be used without introducing any
+stalls.
+
+   ISSUE-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
+the instruction matching the TEST expression begins using this unit
+until a subsequent instruction can begin.  A cost of N indicates an N-1
+cycle delay.  A subsequent instruction may also be delayed if an
+earlier instruction has a longer READY-DELAY value.  This blocking
+effect is computed using the SIMULTANEITY, READY-DELAY, ISSUE-DELAY,
+and CONFLICT-LIST terms.  For a normal non-pipelined function unit,
+SIMULTANEITY is one, the unit is taken to block for the READY-DELAY
+cycles of the executing insn, and smaller values of ISSUE-DELAY are
+ignored.
+
+   CONFLICT-LIST is an optional list giving detailed conflict costs for
+this unit.  If specified, it is a list of condition test expressions to
+be applied to insns chosen to execute in NAME following the particular
+insn matching TEST that is already executing in NAME.  For each insn in
+the list, ISSUE-DELAY specifies the conflict cost; for insns not in the
+list, the cost is zero.  If not specified, CONFLICT-LIST defaults to
+all instructions that use the function unit.
+
+   Typical uses of this vector are where a floating point function unit
+can pipeline either single- or double-precision operations, but not
+both, or where a memory unit can pipeline loads, but not stores, etc.
+
+   As an example, consider a classic RISC machine where the result of a
+load instruction is not available for two cycles (a single "delay"
+instruction is required) and where only one load instruction can be
+executed simultaneously.  This would be specified as:
+
+     (define_function_unit "memory" 1 1 (eq_attr "type" "load") 2 0)
+
+   For the case of a floating point function unit that can pipeline
+either single or double precision, but not both, the following could be
+specified:
+
+     (define_function_unit
+        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "sp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "dp_fp")])
+     (define_function_unit
+        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "dp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "sp_fp")])
+
+   *Note:* The scheduler attempts to avoid function unit conflicts and
+uses all the specifications in the `define_function_unit' expression.
+It has recently come to our attention that these specifications may not
+allow modeling of some of the newer "superscalar" processors that have
+insns using multiple pipelined units.  These insns will cause a
+potential conflict for the second unit used during their execution and
+there is no way of representing that conflict.  We welcome any examples
+of how function unit conflicts work in such processors and suggestions
+for their representation.

+Controlling the Compilation Driver, `gcc'
+=========================================
+
+   You can control the compilation driver.
+
+`SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (CHAR)'
+     A C expression which determines whether the option `-CHAR' takes
+     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
+     option takes-zero, for many options.
+
+     By default, this macro is defined as `DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG',
+     which handles the standard options properly.  You need not define
+     `SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' unless you wish to add additional options which
+     take arguments.  Any redefinition should call
+     `DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' and then check for additional options.
+
+`WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (NAME)'
+     A C expression which determines whether the option `-NAME' takes
+     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
+     option takes-zero, for many options.  This macro rather than
+     `SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' is used for multi-character option names.
+
+     By default, this macro is defined as
+     `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG', which handles the standard options
+     properly.  You need not define `WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' unless you
+     wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any
+     redefinition should call `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' and then
+     check for additional options.
+
+`SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION (CHAR)'
+     A C expression which determines whether the option `-CHAR' stops
+     compilation before the generation of an executable.  The value is
+     boolean, non-zero if the option does stop an executable from being
+     generated, zero otherwise.
+
+     By default, this macro is defined as
+     `DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION', which handles the standard
+     options properly.  You need not define
+     `SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION' unless you wish to add additional
+     options which affect the generation of an executable.  Any
+     redefinition should call `DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION' and
+     then check for additional options.
+
+`SWITCHES_NEED_SPACES'
+     A string-valued C expression which enumerates the options for which
+     the linker needs a space between the option and its argument.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, the default value is `""'.
+
+`CPP_SPEC'
+     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
+     pass to CPP.  It can also specify how to translate options you
+     give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the CPP.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+`NO_BUILTIN_SIZE_TYPE'
+     If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the
+     builtin macro `__SIZE_TYPE__'.  The macro `__SIZE_TYPE__' must
+     then be defined by `CPP_SPEC' instead.
+
+     This should be defined if `SIZE_TYPE' depends on target dependent
+     flags which are not accessible to the preprocessor.  Otherwise, it
+     should not be defined.
+
+`NO_BUILTIN_PTRDIFF_TYPE'
+     If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the
+     builtin macro `__PTRDIFF_TYPE__'.  The macro `__PTRDIFF_TYPE__'
+     must then be defined by `CPP_SPEC' instead.
+
+     This should be defined if `PTRDIFF_TYPE' depends on target
+     dependent flags which are not accessible to the preprocessor.
+     Otherwise, it should not be defined.
+
+`SIGNED_CHAR_SPEC'
+     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
+     pass to CPP.  By default, this macro is defined to pass the option
+     `-D__CHAR_UNSIGNED__' to CPP if `char' will be treated as
+     `unsigned char' by `cc1'.
+
+     Do not define this macro unless you need to override the default
+     definition.
+
+`CC1_SPEC'
+     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
+     pass to `cc1'.  It can also specify how to translate options you
+     give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the `cc1'.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+`CC1PLUS_SPEC'
+     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
+     pass to `cc1plus'.  It can also specify how to translate options
+     you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the
+     `cc1plus'.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+`ASM_SPEC'
+     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
+     pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate
+     options you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the
+     assembler.  See the file `sun3.h' for an example of this.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+`ASM_FINAL_SPEC'
+     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program how to
+     run any programs which cleanup after the normal assembler.
+     Normally, this is not needed.  See the file `mips.h' for an
+     example of this.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+`LINK_SPEC'
+     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
+     pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options
+     you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the linker.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+`LIB_SPEC'
+     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
+     difference between the two is that `LIB_SPEC' is used at the end
+     of the command given to the linker.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
+     standard C library from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.
+
+`LIBGCC_SPEC'
+     Another C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program how
+     and when to place a reference to `libgcc.a' into the linker
+     command line.  This constant is placed both before and after the
+     value of `LIB_SPEC'.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, the GNU CC driver provides a default
+     that passes the string `-lgcc' to the linker unless the `-shared'
+     option is specified.
+
+`STARTFILE_SPEC'
+     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
+     difference between the two is that `STARTFILE_SPEC' is used at the
+     very beginning of the command given to the linker.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
+     standard C startup file from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.
+
+`ENDFILE_SPEC'
+     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
+     difference between the two is that `ENDFILE_SPEC' is used at the
+     very end of the command given to the linker.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+`EXTRA_SPECS'
+     Define this macro to provide additional specifications to put in
+     the `specs' file that can be used in various specifications like
+     `CC1_SPEC'.
+
+     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures,
+     containing a string constant, that defines the specification name,
+     and a string constant that provides the specification.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.
+
+     `EXTRA_SPECS' is useful when an architecture contains several
+     related targets, which have various `..._SPECS' which are similar
+     to each other, and the maintainer would like one central place to
+     keep these definitions.
+
+     For example, the PowerPC System V.4 targets use `EXTRA_SPECS' to
+     define either `_CALL_SYSV' when the System V calling sequence is
+     used or `_CALL_AIX' when the older AIX-based calling sequence is
+     used.
+
+     The `config/rs6000/rs6000.h' target file defines:
+
+          #define EXTRA_SPECS \
+            { "cpp_sysv_default", CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT },
+          
+          #define CPP_SYS_DEFAULT ""
+
+     The `config/rs6000/sysv.h' target file defines:
+          #undef CPP_SPEC
+          #define CPP_SPEC \
+          "%{posix: -D_POSIX_SOURCE } \
+          %{mcall-sysv: -D_CALL_SYSV } %{mcall-aix: -D_CALL_AIX } \
+          %{!mcall-sysv: %{!mcall-aix: %(cpp_sysv_default) }} \
+          %{msoft-float: -D_SOFT_FLOAT} %{mcpu=403: -D_SOFT_FLOAT}"
+          
+          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
+          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_SYSV"
+
+     while the `config/rs6000/eabiaix.h' target file defines
+     `CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT' as:
+
+          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
+          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_AIX"
+
+`LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL'
+     Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
+     `libgcc.a' itself and should not pass `-L' options to the linker.
+     If you do not define this macro, the driver program will pass the
+     argument `-lgcc' to tell the linker to do the search and will pass
+     `-L' options to it.
+
+`LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL_1'
+     Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
+     `libgcc.a'.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program
+     will pass the argument `-lgcc' to tell the linker to do the search.
+     This macro is similar to `LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL', except that it does
+     not affect `-L' options.
+
+`LINK_COMMAND_SPEC'
+     A C string constant giving the complete command line need to
+     execute the linker.  When you do this, you will need to update
+     your port each time a change is made to the link command line
+     within `gcc.c'.  Therefore, define this macro only if you need to
+     completely redefine the command line for invoking the linker and
+     there is no other way to accomplish the effect you need.
+
+`MULTILIB_DEFAULTS'
+     Define this macro as a C expression for the initializer of an
+     array of string to tell the driver program which options are
+     defaults for this target and thus do not need to be handled
+     specially when using `MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.
+
+     Do not define this macro if `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is not defined in
+     the target makefile fragment or if none of the options listed in
+     `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' are set by default.  *Note Target Fragment::.
+
+`RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR'
+     Define this macro to tell `gcc' that it should only translate a
+     `-B' prefix into a `-L' linker option if the prefix indicates an
+     absolute file name.
+
+`STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
+     the standard choice of `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/' as the default
+     prefix to try when searching for the executable files of the
+     compiler.
+
+`MD_EXEC_PREFIX'
+     If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
+     `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
+     `-b' option is used, or the compiler is built as a cross compiler.
+     If you define `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', then be sure to add it to the
+     list of directories used to find the assembler in `configure.in'.
+
+`STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
+     the standard choice of `/usr/local/lib/' as the default prefix to
+     try when searching for startup files such as `crt0.o'.
+
+`MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'
+     If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after
+     the standard prefixes.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
+     `-b' option is used, or when the compiler is built as a cross
+     compiler.
+
+`MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1'
+     If defined, this macro supplies yet another prefix to try after the
+     standard prefixes.  It is not searched when the `-b' option is
+     used, or when the compiler is built as a cross compiler.
+
+`INIT_ENVIRONMENT'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to set
+     environment variables for programs called by the driver, such as
+     the assembler and loader.  The driver passes the value of this
+     macro to `putenv' to initialize the necessary environment
+     variables.
+
+`LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
+     the standard choice of `/usr/local/include' as the default prefix
+     to try when searching for local header files.  `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
+     comes before `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.
+
+     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
+     `/usr/local/include' or its replacement.
+
+`SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to specify a
+     system-specific directory to search for header files before the
+     standard directory.  `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' comes before
+     `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.
+
+     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search the
+     directory specified.
+
+`STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
+     the standard choice of `/usr/include' as the default prefix to try
+     when searching for header files.
+
+     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
+     `/usr/include' or its replacement.
+
+`STANDARD_INCLUDE_COMPONENT'
+     The "component" corresponding to `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  See
+     `INCLUDE_DEFAULTS', below, for the description of components.  If
+     you do not define this macro, no component is used.
+
+`INCLUDE_DEFAULTS'
+     Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default
+     search path for include files.  For a native compiler, the default
+     search path usually consists of `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR',
+     `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR', `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR',
+     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR', and `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  In addition,
+     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' and `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' are defined
+     automatically by `Makefile', and specify private search areas for
+     GCC.  The directory `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for C++
+     programs.
+
+     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
+     Each array element should have four elements: the directory name (a
+     string constant), the component name, and flag for C++-only
+     directories, and a flag showing that the includes in the directory
+     don't need to be wrapped in `extern `C'' when compiling C++.  Mark
+     the end of the array with a null element.
+
+     The component name denotes what GNU package the include file is
+     part of, if any, in all upper-case letters.  For example, it might
+     be `GCC' or `BINUTILS'.  If the package is part of the a
+     vendor-supplied operating system, code the component name as `0'.
+
+     For example, here is the definition used for VAX/VMS:
+
+          #define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
+          {                                       \
+            { "GNU_GXX_INCLUDE:", "G++", 1, 1},   \
+            { "GNU_CC_INCLUDE:", "GCC", 0, 0},    \
+            { "SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]", 0, 0, 0},  \
+            { ".", 0, 0, 0},                      \
+            { 0, 0, 0, 0}                         \
+          }
+
+   Here is the order of prefixes tried for exec files:
+
+  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.
+
+  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.
+
+  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
+     `COMPILER_PATH'.
+
+  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.
+
+  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.
+
+  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.
+
+   Here is the order of prefixes tried for startfiles:
+
+  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.
+
+  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.
+
+  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
+     `LIBRARY_PATH' (native only, cross compilers do not use this).
+
+  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.
+
+  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.
+
+  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.
+
+  7. The macro `MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX', if any.
+
+  8. The macro `STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'.
+
+  9. `/lib/'.
+
+ 10. `/usr/lib/'.

+
+Run-time Target Specification
+=============================
+
+   Here are run-time target specifications.
+
+`CPP_PREDEFINES'
+     Define this to be a string constant containing `-D' options to
+     define the predefined macros that identify this machine and system.
+     These macros will be predefined unless the `-ansi' option is
+     specified.
+
+     In addition, a parallel set of macros are predefined, whose names
+     are made by appending `__' at the beginning and at the end.  These
+     `__' macros are permitted by the ANSI standard, so they are
+     predefined regardless of whether `-ansi' is specified.
+
+     For example, on the Sun, one can use the following value:
+
+          "-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix"
+
+     The result is to define the macros `__mc68000__', `__sun__' and
+     `__unix__' unconditionally, and the macros `mc68000', `sun' and
+     `unix' provided `-ansi' is not specified.
+
+`extern int target_flags;'
+     This declaration should be present.
+
+`TARGET_...'
+     This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
+     enable or disable the use of optional features of the target
+     machine.  For example, one machine description serves both the
+     68000 and the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether
+     it should use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command
+     argument works by means of a macro `TARGET_68020' that tests a bit
+     in `target_flags'.
+
+     Define a macro `TARGET_FEATURENAME' for each such option.  Its
+     definition should test a bit in `target_flags'; for example:
+
+          #define TARGET_68020 (target_flags & 1)
+
+     One place where these macros are used is in the
+     condition-expressions of instruction patterns.  Note how
+     `TARGET_68020' appears frequently in the 68000 machine description
+     file, `m68k.md'.  Another place they are used is in the
+     definitions of the other macros in the `MACHINE.h' file.
+
+`TARGET_SWITCHES'
+     This macro defines names of command options to set and clear bits
+     in `target_flags'.  Its definition is an initializer with a
+     subgrouping for each command option.
+
+     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
+     option name, a number, which contains the bits to set in
+     `target_flags', and a second string which is the description
+     displayed by -help.  If the number is negative then the bits
+     specified by the number are cleared instead of being set.  If the
+     description string is present but empty, then no help information
+     will be displayed for that option, but it will not count as an
+     undocumented option.  The actual option name is made by appending
+     `-m' to the specified name.
+
+     One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
+     this grouping is the default value for `target_flags'.  Any target
+     options act starting with that value.
+
+     Here is an example which defines `-m68000' and `-m68020' with
+     opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:
+
+          #define TARGET_SWITCHES \
+            { { "68020", 1, "" },      \
+              { "68000", -1, "Compile for the 68000" }, \
+              { "", 1, "" }}
+
+`TARGET_OPTIONS'
+     This macro is similar to `TARGET_SWITCHES' but defines names of
+     command options that have values.  Its definition is an
+     initializer with a subgrouping for each command option.
+
+     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
+     fixed part of the option name, the address of a variable, and a
+     description string.  The variable, type `char *', is set to the
+     variable part of the given option if the fixed part matches.  The
+     actual option name is made by appending `-m' to the specified name.
+
+     Here is an example which defines `-mshort-data-NUMBER'.  If the
+     given option is `-mshort-data-512', the variable `m88k_short_data'
+     will be set to the string `"512"'.
+
+          extern char *m88k_short_data;
+          #define TARGET_OPTIONS \
+           { { "short-data-", &m88k_short_data, "Specify the size of the short data section" } }
+
+`TARGET_VERSION'
+     This macro is a C statement to print on `stderr' a string
+     describing the particular machine description choice.  Every
+     machine description should define `TARGET_VERSION'.  For example:
+
+          #ifdef MOTOROLA
+          #define TARGET_VERSION \
+            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, Motorola syntax)");
+          #else
+          #define TARGET_VERSION \
+            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, MIT syntax)");
+          #endif
+
+`OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'
+     Sometimes certain combinations of command options do not make
+     sense on a particular target machine.  You can define a macro
+     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS' to take account of this.  This macro, if
+     defined, is executed once just after all the command options have
+     been parsed.
+
+     Don't use this macro to turn on various extra optimizations for
+     `-O'.  That is what `OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS' is for.
+
+`OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS (LEVEL, SIZE)'
+     Some machines may desire to change what optimizations are
+     performed for various optimization levels.   This macro, if
+     defined, is executed once just after the optimization level is
+     determined and before the remainder of the command options have
+     been parsed.  Values set in this macro are used as the default
+     values for the other command line options.
+
+     LEVEL is the optimization level specified; 2 if `-O2' is
+     specified, 1 if `-O' is specified, and 0 if neither is specified.
+
+     SIZE is non-zero if `-Os' is specified and zero otherwise.
+
+     You should not use this macro to change options that are not
+     machine-specific.  These should uniformly selected by the same
+     optimization level on all supported machines.  Use this macro to
+     enable machine-specific optimizations.
+
+     *Do not examine `write_symbols' in this macro!* The debugging
+     options are not supposed to alter the generated code.
+
+`CAN_DEBUG_WITHOUT_FP'
+     Define this macro if debugging can be performed even without a
+     frame pointer.  If this macro is defined, GNU CC will turn on the
+     `-fomit-frame-pointer' option whenever `-O' is specified.

+
+Storage Layout
+==============
+
+   Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are
+sizes or alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.  They
+can be C expressions that refer to static variables, such as the
+`target_flags'.  *Note Run-time Target::.
+
+`BITS_BIG_ENDIAN'
+     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit
+     in a byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the
+     value zero.  This means that bit-field instructions count from the
+     most significant bit.  If the machine has no bit-field
+     instructions, then this must still be defined, but it doesn't
+     matter which value it is defined to.  This macro need not be a
+     constant.
+
+     This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
+     bytes or words; that is controlled by `BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'.
+
+`BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'
+     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant byte
+     in a word has the lowest number.  This macro need not be a
+     constant.
+
+`WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
+     Define this macro to have the value 1 if, in a multiword object,
+     the most significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to
+     both memory locations and registers; GNU CC fundamentally assumes
+     that the order of words in memory is the same as the order in
+     registers.  This macro need not be a constant.
+
+`LIBGCC2_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
+     Define this macro if WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN is not constant.  This must
+     be a constant value with the same meaning as WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN,
+     which will be used only when compiling libgcc2.c.  Typically the
+     value will be set based on preprocessor defines.
+
+`FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
+     Define this macro to have the value 1 if `DFmode', `XFmode' or
+     `TFmode' floating point numbers are stored in memory with the word
+     containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise define it
+     to have the value 0.  This macro need not be a constant.
+
+     You need not define this macro if the ordering is the same as for
+     multi-word integers.
+
+`BITS_PER_UNIT'
+     Define this macro to be the number of bits in an addressable
+     storage unit (byte); normally 8.
+
+`BITS_PER_WORD'
+     Number of bits in a word; normally 32.
+
+`MAX_BITS_PER_WORD'
+     Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the
+     default is `BITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
+     that is the largest value that `BITS_PER_WORD' can have at
+     run-time.
+
+`UNITS_PER_WORD'
+     Number of storage units in a word; normally 4.
+
+`MIN_UNITS_PER_WORD'
+     Minimum number of units in a word.  If this is undefined, the
+     default is `UNITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
+     that is the smallest value that `UNITS_PER_WORD' can have at
+     run-time.
+
+`POINTER_SIZE'
+     Width of a pointer, in bits.  You must specify a value no wider
+     than the width of `Pmode'.  If it is not equal to the width of
+     `Pmode', you must define `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED'.
+
+`POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED'
+     A C expression whose value is nonzero if pointers that need to be
+     extended from being `POINTER_SIZE' bits wide to `Pmode' are to be
+     zero-extended and zero if they are to be sign-extended.
+
+     You need not define this macro if the `POINTER_SIZE' is equal to
+     the width of `Pmode'.
+
+`PROMOTE_MODE (M, UNSIGNEDP, TYPE)'
+     A macro to update M and UNSIGNEDP when an object whose type is
+     TYPE and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
+     stored in a register.  This macro is only called when TYPE is a
+     scalar type.
+
+     On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on
+     a full register, define this macro to set M to `word_mode' if M is
+     an integer mode narrower than `BITS_PER_WORD'.  In most cases,
+     only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
+     floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their
+     narrower counterparts.
+
+     For most machines, the macro definition does not change UNSIGNEDP.
+     However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially
+     handle either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For
+     example, on the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add
+     instructions sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines,
+     set UNSIGNEDP according to which kind of extension is more
+     efficient.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it would never modify M.
+
+`PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS'
+     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
+     should also be done for outgoing function arguments.
+
+`PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN'
+     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
+     should also be done for the return value of functions.
+
+     If this macro is defined, `FUNCTION_VALUE' must perform the same
+     promotions done by `PROMOTE_MODE'.
+
+`PROMOTE_FOR_CALL_ONLY'
+     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
+     should *only* be performed for outgoing function arguments or
+     function return values, as specified by `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS'
+     and `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN', respectively.
+
+`PARM_BOUNDARY'
+     Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
+     bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
+     regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
+     size of an integer.
+
+`STACK_BOUNDARY'
+     Define this macro if there is a guaranteed alignment for the stack
+     pointer on this machine.  The definition is a C expression for the
+     desired alignment (measured in bits).  This value is used as a
+     default if PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY is not defined.
+
+`PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY'
+     Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
+     the stack pointer.  The definition is a C expression for the
+     desired alignment (measured in bits).  If STACK_BOUNDARY is also
+     defined, this macro must evaluate to a value equal to or larger
+     than STACK_BOUNDARY.
+
+     If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is not defined, the stack will always be aligned
+     to the specified boundary.  If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is defined and
+     specifies a less strict alignment than `PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY',
+     the stack may be momentarily unaligned while pushing arguments.
+
+`FUNCTION_BOUNDARY'
+     Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.
+
+`BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
+     Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine,
+     in bits.
+
+`MINIMUM_ATOMIC_ALIGNMENT'
+     If defined, the smallest alignment, in bits, that can be given to
+     an object that can be referenced in one operation, without
+     disturbing any nearby object.  Normally, this is `BITS_PER_UNIT',
+     but may be larger on machines that don't have byte or half-word
+     store operations.
+
+`BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT'
+     Biggest alignment that any structure field can require on this
+     machine, in bits.  If defined, this overrides `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
+     for structure fields only.
+
+`ADJUST_FIELD_ALIGN (FIELD, COMPUTED)'
+     An expression for the alignment of a structure field FIELD if the
+     alignment computed in the usual way is COMPUTED.  GNU CC uses this
+     value instead of the value in `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT' or
+     `BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT', if defined, for structure fields only.
+
+`MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT'
+     Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this
+     machine.  Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be
+     specified using the `__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))' construct.  If
+     not defined, the default value is `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.
+
+`DATA_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)'
+     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a
+     variables in the static store.  TYPE is the data type, and
+     BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
+     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment
+     to align the object.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.
+
+     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
+     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause
+     character arrays to be word-aligned so that `strcpy' calls that
+     copy constants to character arrays can be done inline.
+
+`CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (CONSTANT, BASIC-ALIGN)'
+     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a
+     constant that is being placed in memory.  CONSTANT is the constant
+     and BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
+     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
+     align the object.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.
+
+     The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
+     constants to be word aligned so that `strcpy' calls that copy
+     constants can be done inline.
+
+`LOCAL_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)'
+     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a
+     variables in the local store.  TYPE is the data type, and
+     BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
+     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment
+     to align the object.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.
+
+     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
+     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.
+
+`EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY'
+     Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit field that
+     follows an empty field such as `int : 0;'.
+
+     Note that `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' also affects the alignment
+     that results from an empty field.
+
+`STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY'
+     Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a
+     multiple of.  Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a
+     multiple of this.
+
+     If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
+     `BITS_PER_UNIT'.
+
+`STRICT_ALIGNMENT'
+     Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to
+     work if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions
+     will merely go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.
+
+`PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'
+     Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers
+     handle alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.
+
+     The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (`int',
+     `short', or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
+     entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an
+     ordinary field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed
+     within the structure so that it would fit within such a field, not
+     crossing a boundary for it.
+
+     Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as `int'
+     would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
+     alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be
+     four bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)
+
+     If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
+     a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.
+
+     Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
+     bitfields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The
+     compiler can support such references if there are `insv', `extv',
+     and `extzv' insns that can directly reference memory.
+
+     The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
+     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' as large as `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.  Then
+     every structure can be accessed with fullwords.
+
+     Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
+     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' that way, you must define
+     `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' to have a nonzero value.
+
+     If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying
+     out bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to
+     investigate what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this
+     program:
+
+          struct foo1
+          {
+            char x;
+            char :0;
+            char y;
+          };
+          
+          struct foo2
+          {
+            char x;
+            int :0;
+            char y;
+          };
+          
+          main ()
+          {
+            printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
+                    sizeof (struct foo1));
+            printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
+                    sizeof (struct foo2));
+            exit (0);
+          }
+
+     If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you
+     would get from `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'.
+
+`BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED'
+     Like PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS except that its effect is limited to
+     aligning a bitfield within the structure.
+
+`ROUND_TYPE_SIZE (TYPE, COMPUTED, SPECIFIED)'
+     Define this macro as an expression for the overall size of a type
+     (given by TYPE as a tree node) when the size computed in the usual
+     way is COMPUTED and the alignment is SPECIFIED.
+
+     The default is to round COMPUTED up to a multiple of SPECIFIED.
+
+`ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (TYPE, COMPUTED, SPECIFIED)'
+     Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a type
+     (given by TYPE as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the
+     usual way is COMPUTED and the alignment explicitly specified was
+     SPECIFIED.
+
+     The default is to use SPECIFIED if it is larger; otherwise, use
+     the smaller of COMPUTED and `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
+
+`MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'
+     An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
+     machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine
+     modes of this size or smaller can be used for structures and
+     unions with the appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined,
+     `GET_MODE_BITSIZE (DImode)' is assumed.
+
+`STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE (SAVE_LEVEL)'
+     If defined, an expression of type `enum machine_mode' that
+     specifies the mode of the save area operand of a
+     `save_stack_LEVEL' named pattern (*note Standard Names::.).
+     SAVE_LEVEL is one of `SAVE_BLOCK', `SAVE_FUNCTION', or
+     `SAVE_NONLOCAL' and selects which of the three named patterns is
+     having its mode specified.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it always returns `Pmode'.  You
+     would most commonly define this macro if the `save_stack_LEVEL'
+     patterns need to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.
+
+`STACK_SIZE_MODE'
+     If defined, an expression of type `enum machine_mode' that
+     specifies the mode of the size increment operand of an
+     `allocate_stack' named pattern (*note Standard Names::.).
+
+     You need not define this macro if it always returns `word_mode'.
+     You would most commonly define this macro if the `allocate_stack'
+     pattern needs to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.
+
+`CHECK_FLOAT_VALUE (MODE, VALUE, OVERFLOW)'
+     A C statement to validate the value VALUE (of type `double') for
+     mode MODE.  This means that you check whether VALUE fits within
+     the possible range of values for mode MODE on this target machine.
+     The mode MODE is always a mode of class `MODE_FLOAT'.  OVERFLOW
+     is nonzero if the value is already known to be out of range.
+
+     If VALUE is not valid or if OVERFLOW is nonzero, you should set
+     OVERFLOW to 1 and then assign some valid value to VALUE.  Allowing
+     an invalid value to go through the compiler can produce incorrect
+     assembler code which may even cause Unix assemblers to crash.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if there is no work for it to do.
+
+`TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT'
+     A code distinguishing the floating point format of the target
+     machine.  There are three defined values:
+
+    `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'
+          This code indicates IEEE floating point.  It is the default;
+          there is no need to define this macro when the format is IEEE.
+
+    `VAX_FLOAT_FORMAT'
+          This code indicates the peculiar format used on the Vax.
+
+    `UNKNOWN_FLOAT_FORMAT'
+          This code indicates any other format.
+
+     The value of this macro is compared with `HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT'
+     (*note Config::.) to determine whether the target machine has the
+     same format as the host machine.  If any other formats are
+     actually in use on supported machines, new codes should be defined
+     for them.
+
+     The ordering of the component words of floating point values
+     stored in memory is controlled by `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' for the
+     target machine and `HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' for the host.
+
+`DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS'
+     GNU CC supports two ways of implementing C++ vtables:  traditional
+     or with so-called "thunks".  The flag `-fvtable-thunk' chooses
+     between them.  Define this macro to be a C expression for the
+     default value of that flag.  If `DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS' is 0, GNU
+     CC uses the traditional implementation by default.  The "thunk"
+     implementation is more efficient (especially if you have provided
+     an implementation of `ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK', see *Note Function
+     Entry::), but is not binary compatible with code compiled using
+     the traditional implementation.  If you are writing a new ports,
+     define `DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS' to 1.
+
+     If you do not define this macro, the default for `-fvtable-thunk'
+     is 0.

+
+Layout of Source Language Data Types
+====================================
+
+   These macros define the sizes and other characteristics of the
+standard basic data types used in programs being compiled.  Unlike the
+macros in the previous section, these apply to specific features of C
+and related languages, rather than to fundamental aspects of storage
+layout.
+
+`INT_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `int' on the
+     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.
+
+`MAX_INT_TYPE_SIZE'
+     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `int' on the target
+     machine.  If this is undefined, the default is `INT_TYPE_SIZE'.
+     Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the largest value that
+     `INT_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is used in `cpp'.
+
+`SHORT_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `short' on the
+     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is half a
+     word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded
+     up to one unit.)
+
+`LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
+     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.
+
+`MAX_LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
+     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
+     target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
+     `LONG_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
+     largest value that `LONG_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
+     used in `cpp'.
+
+`LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long long' on the
+     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
+     words.  If you want to support GNU Ada on your machine, the value
+     of macro must be at least 64.
+
+`CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `char' on the
+     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one
+     quarter of a word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit,
+     it is rounded up to one unit.)
+
+`MAX_CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
+     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `char' on the
+     target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
+     `CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
+     largest value that `CHAR_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
+     used in `cpp'.
+
+`FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `float' on the
+     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.
+
+`DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `double' on the
+     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
+     words.
+
+`LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long double' on
+     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
+     words.
+
+`WIDEST_HARDWARE_FP_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the widest floating-point
+     format supported by the hardware.  If you define this macro, you
+     must specify a value less than or equal to the value of
+     `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  If you do not define this macro, the
+     value of `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is the default.
+
+`DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR'
+     An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
+     `char' should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
+     always override this default with the options `-fsigned-char' and
+     `-funsigned-char'.
+
+`DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS'
+     A C expression to determine whether to give an `enum' type only as
+     many bytes as it takes to represent the range of possible values
+     of that type.  A nonzero value means to do that; a zero value
+     means all `enum' types should be allocated like `int'.
+
+     If you don't define the macro, the default is 0.
+
+`SIZE_TYPE'
+     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
+     to use for size values.  The typedef name `size_t' is defined
+     using the contents of the string.
+
+     The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate
+     them with spaces, and write first any length keyword, then
+     `unsigned' if appropriate, and finally `int'.  The string must
+     exactly match one of the data type names defined in the function
+     `init_decl_processing' in the file `c-decl.c'.  You may not omit
+     `int' or change the order--that would cause the compiler to crash
+     on startup.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long unsigned
+     int"'.
+
+`PTRDIFF_TYPE'
+     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
+     to use for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef
+     name `ptrdiff_t' is defined using the contents of the string.  See
+     `SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long int"'.
+
+`WCHAR_TYPE'
+     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
+     to use for wide characters.  The typedef name `wchar_t' is defined
+     using the contents of the string.  See `SIZE_TYPE' above for more
+     information.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"int"'.
+
+`WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
+     characters.  This is used in `cpp', which cannot make use of
+     `WCHAR_TYPE'.
+
+`MAX_WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
+     Maximum number for the size in bits of the data type for wide
+     characters.  If this is undefined, the default is
+     `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
+     largest value that `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
+     used in `cpp'.
+
+`OBJC_INT_SELECTORS'
+     Define this macro if the type of Objective C selectors should be
+     `int'.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, then selectors should have the type
+     `struct objc_selector *'.
+
+`OBJC_SELECTORS_WITHOUT_LABELS'
+     Define this macro if the compiler can group all the selectors
+     together into a vector and use just one label at the beginning of
+     the vector.  Otherwise, the compiler must give each selector its
+     own assembler label.
+
+     On certain machines, it is important to have a separate label for
+     each selector because this enables the linker to eliminate
+     duplicate selectors.
+
+`TARGET_BELL'
+     A C constant expression for the integer value for escape sequence
+     `\a'.
+
+`TARGET_BS'
+`TARGET_TAB'
+`TARGET_NEWLINE'
+     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
+     `\b', `\t' and `\n'.
+
+`TARGET_VT'
+`TARGET_FF'
+`TARGET_CR'
+     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
+     `\v', `\f' and `\r'.

+
+Basic Characteristics of Registers
+----------------------------------
+
+   Registers have various characteristics.
+
+`FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'
+     Number of hardware registers known to the compiler.  They receive
+     numbers 0 through `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER-1'; thus, the first
+     pseudo register's number really is assigned the number
+     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'.
+
+`FIXED_REGISTERS'
+     An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed
+     purposes all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not
+     available for general allocation.  These would include the stack
+     pointer, the frame pointer (except on machines where that can be
+     used as a general register when no frame pointer is needed), the
+     program counter on machines where that is considered one of the
+     addressable registers, and any other numbered register with a
+     standard use.
+
+     This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated
+     by commas and surrounded by braces.  The Nth number is 1 if
+     register N is fixed, 0 otherwise.
+
+     The table initialized from this macro, and the table initialized by
+     the following one, may be overridden at run time either
+     automatically, by the actions of the macro
+     `CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE', or by the user with the command
+     options `-ffixed-REG', `-fcall-used-REG' and `-fcall-saved-REG'.
+
+`CALL_USED_REGISTERS'
+     Like `FIXED_REGISTERS' but has 1 for each register that is
+     clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
+     registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are
+     not available for general allocation of values that must live
+     across function calls.
+
+     If a register has 0 in `CALL_USED_REGISTERS', the compiler
+     automatically saves it on function entry and restores it on
+     function exit, if the register is used within the function.
+
+`HARD_REGNO_CALL_PART_CLOBBERED (REGNO, MODE)'
+     A C expression that is non-zero if it is not permissible to store a
+     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO across a call
+     without some part of it being clobbered.  For most machines this
+     macro need not be defined.  It is only required for machines that
+     do not preserve the entire contents of a register across a call.
+
+`CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE'
+     Zero or more C statements that may conditionally modify four
+     variables `fixed_regs', `call_used_regs', `global_regs' (these
+     three are of type `char []') and `reg_class_contents' (of type
+     `HARD_REG_SET').  Before the macro is called `fixed_regs',
+     `call_used_regs' and `reg_class_contents' have been initialized
+     from `FIXED_REGISTERS', `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' and
+     `REG_CLASS_CONTENTS', respectively, `global_regs' has been
+     cleared, and any `-ffixed-REG', `-fcall-used-REG' and
+     `-fcall-saved-REG' command options have been applied.
+
+     This is necessary in case the fixed or call-clobbered registers
+     depend on target flags.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it has no work to do.
+
+     If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target
+     flags, you may indicate this to GCC by using this macro to modify
+     `fixed_regs' and `call_used_regs' to 1 for each of the registers
+     in the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define the
+     macro `REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' to return `NO_REGS' if it is called
+     with a letter for a class that shouldn't be used.
+
+     (However, if this class is not included in `GENERAL_REGS' and all
+     of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
+     controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid
+     using these registers when the target switches are opposed to
+     them.)
+
+`NON_SAVING_SETJMP'
+     If this macro is defined and has a nonzero value, it means that
+     `setjmp' and related functions fail to save the registers, or that
+     `longjmp' fails to restore them.  To compensate, the compiler
+     avoids putting variables in registers in functions that use
+     `setjmp'.
+
+`INCOMING_REGNO (OUT)'
+     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
+     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
+     called function corresponding to the register number OUT as seen
+     by the calling function.  Return OUT if register number OUT is not
+     an outbound register.
+
+`OUTGOING_REGNO (IN)'
+     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
+     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
+     calling function corresponding to the register number IN as seen
+     by the called function.  Return IN if register number IN is not an
+     inbound register.

+
+Order of Allocation of Registers
+--------------------------------
+
+   Registers are allocated in order.
+
+`REG_ALLOC_ORDER'
+     If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
+     numbers of hard registers in the order in which GNU CC should
+     prefer to use them (from most preferred to least).
+
+     If this macro is not defined, registers are used lowest numbered
+     first (all else being equal).
+
+     One use of this macro is on machines where the highest numbered
+     registers must always be saved and the save-multiple-registers
+     instruction supports only sequences of consecutive registers.  On
+     such machines, define `REG_ALLOC_ORDER' to be an initializer that
+     lists the highest numbered allocable register first.
+
+`ORDER_REGS_FOR_LOCAL_ALLOC'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to choose the order in which to
+     allocate hard registers for pseudo-registers local to a basic
+     block.
+
+     Store the desired register order in the array `reg_alloc_order'.
+     Element 0 should be the register to allocate first; element 1, the
+     next register; and so on.
+
+     The macro body should not assume anything about the contents of
+     `reg_alloc_order' before execution of the macro.
+
+     On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.

+
+How Values Fit in Registers
+---------------------------
+
+   This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
+(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
+consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.
+
+`HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)'
+     A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers,
+     starting at register number REGNO, required to hold a value of mode
+     MODE.
+
+     On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
+     definition of this macro is
+
+          #define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
+             ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
+              / UNITS_PER_WORD))
+
+`ALTER_HARD_SUBREG (TGT_MODE, WORD, SRC_MODE, REGNO)'
+     A C expression that returns an adjusted hard register number for
+
+          (subreg:TGT_MODE (reg:SRC_MODE REGNO) WORD)
+
+     This may be needed if the target machine has mixed sized big-endian
+     registers, like Sparc v9.
+
+`HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (REGNO, MODE)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a
+     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO (or in several
+     registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all
+     registers are equivalent, a suitable definition is
+
+          #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1
+
+     You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed
+     registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them to be
+     always occupied.
+
+     On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
+     register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this macro to
+     reject odd register numbers for such modes.
+
+     The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that
+     the `movMODE' instruction pattern support moves between the
+     register and other hard register in the same class and that moving
+     a value into the register and back out not alter it.
+
+     Since the same instruction used to move `word_mode' will work for
+     all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
+     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' to distinguish between these modes, provided
+     you define patterns `movhi', etc., to take advantage of this.  This
+     is useful because of the interaction between `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
+     and `MODES_TIEABLE_P'; it is very desirable for all integer modes
+     to be tieable.
+
+     Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
+     Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed
+     only in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any
+     registers that can hold integers can safely *hold* a floating
+     point machine mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done
+     on it in those registers.  Integer move instructions can be used
+     to move the values.
+
+     On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
+     modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the
+     floating registers normalize any value stored in them, because
+     storing a non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
+     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' should reject fixed-point machine modes in
+     floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not
+     automatically normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one
+     and retrieve it unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode
+     may go in a floating register, so you can define this macro to say
+     so.
+
+     The primary significance of special floating registers is rather
+     that they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
+     instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
+     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.  You handle it by writing the proper
+     constraints for those instructions.
+
+     On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to
+     access, so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame
+     than in such a register if floating point arithmetic is not being
+     done.  As long as the floating registers are not in class
+     `GENERAL_REGS', they will not be used unless some pattern's
+     constraint asks for one.
+
+`MODES_TIEABLE_P (MODE1, MODE2)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if a value of mode MODE1 is
+     accessible in mode MODE2 without copying.
+
+     If `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R, MODE1)' and `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R,
+     MODE2)' are always the same for any R, then `MODES_TIEABLE_P
+     (MODE1, MODE2)' should be nonzero.  If they differ for any R, you
+     should define this macro to return zero unless some other
+     mechanism ensures the accessibility of the value in a narrower
+     mode.
+
+     You should define this macro to return nonzero in as many cases as
+     possible since doing so will allow GNU CC to perform better
+     register allocation.
+
+`AVOID_CCMODE_COPIES'
+     Define this macro if the compiler should avoid copies to/from
+     `CCmode' registers.  You should only define this macro if support
+     fo copying to/from `CCmode' is incomplete.

+
+Handling Leaf Functions
+-----------------------
+
+   On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls)
+can run more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.
+Often this means it is required to receive its arguments in the
+registers where they are passed by the caller, instead of the registers
+where they would normally arrive.
+
+   The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
+other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
+registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
+function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special
+handling, so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf
+functions".
+
+   GNU CC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function
+is suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
+registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
+accomplish this.
+
+`LEAF_REGISTERS'
+     A C initializer for a vector, indexed by hard register number,
+     which contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate
+     for leaf function treatment.
+
+     If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers,
+     then the registers marked here should be the ones before
+     renumbering--those that GNU CC would ordinarily allocate.  The
+     registers which will actually be used in the assembler code, after
+     renumbering, should not be marked with 1 in this vector.
+
+     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
+     optimize the treatment of leaf functions.
+
+`LEAF_REG_REMAP (REGNO)'
+     A C expression whose value is the register number to which REGNO
+     should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf
+     function.
+
+     If REGNO is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
+     function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1,
+     which will cause the compiler to abort.
+
+     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
+     optimize the treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be
+     renumbered to do this.
+
+   Normally, `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat
+leaf functions specially.  They can test the C variable
+`current_function_is_leaf' which is nonzero for leaf functions.
+`current_function_is_leaf' is set prior to local register allocation
+and is valid for the remaining compiler passes.  They can also test the
+C variable `current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' which is nonzero for
+leaf functions which only use leaf registers.
+`current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' is valid after reload and is
+only useful if `LEAF_REGISTERS' is defined.

+Registers That Form a Stack
+---------------------------
+
+   There are special features to handle computers where some of the
+"registers" form a stack, as in the 80387 coprocessor for the 80386.
+Stack registers are normally written by pushing onto the stack, and are
+numbered relative to the top of the stack.
+
+   Currently, GNU CC can only handle one group of stack-like registers,
+and they must be consecutively numbered.
+
+`STACK_REGS'
+     Define this if the machine has any stack-like registers.
+
+`FIRST_STACK_REG'
+     The number of the first stack-like register.  This one is the top
+     of the stack.
+
+`LAST_STACK_REG'
+     The number of the last stack-like register.  This one is the
+     bottom of the stack.
+

+
+Obsolete Macros for Controlling Register Usage
+----------------------------------------------
+
+   These features do not work very well.  They exist because they used
+to be required to generate correct code for the 80387 coprocessor of the
+80386.  They are no longer used by that machine description and may be
+removed in a later version of the compiler.  Don't use them!
+
+`OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
+     If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if hard
+     register number REGNO is an overlapping register.  This means a
+     hard register which overlaps a hard register with a different
+     number.  (Such overlap is undesirable, but occasionally it allows
+     a machine to be supported which otherwise could not be.)  This
+     macro must return nonzero for *all* the registers which overlap
+     each other.  GNU CC can use an overlapping register only in
+     certain limited ways.  It can be used for allocation within a
+     basic block, and may be spilled for reloading; that is all.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, it means that none of the hard
+     registers overlap each other.  This is the usual situation.
+
+`INSN_CLOBBERS_REGNO_P (INSN, REGNO)'
+     If defined, this is a C expression whose value should be nonzero if
+     the insn INSN has the effect of mysteriously clobbering the
+     contents of hard register number REGNO.  By "mysterious" we mean
+     that the insn's RTL expression doesn't describe such an effect.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, it means that no insn clobbers
+     registers mysteriously.  This is the usual situation; all else
+     being equal, it is best for the RTL expression to show all the
+     activity.

+
+Register Classes
+================
+
+   On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent.
+For example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed
+addressing; certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.
+These machine restrictions are described to the compiler using
+"register classes".
+
+   You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and
+saying which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify
+register classes that are allowed as operands to particular instruction
+patterns.
+
+   In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact,
+one class must be named `ALL_REGS' and contain all the registers.
+Another class must be named `NO_REGS' and contain no registers.  Often
+the union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not
+required.
+
+   One of the classes must be named `GENERAL_REGS'.  There is nothing
+terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters `r'
+and `g' specify this class.  If `GENERAL_REGS' is the same as
+`ALL_REGS', just define it as a macro which expands to `ALL_REGS'.
+
+   Order the classes so that if class X is contained in class Y then X
+has a lower class number than Y.
+
+   The way classes other than `GENERAL_REGS' are specified in operand
+constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters.
+You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
+them in operand constraints.
+
+   You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
+instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
+either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register
+for a certain operand, you should define a class `FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS'
+which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.
+
+   You must also specify certain redundant information about the
+register classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which
+ones are contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class
+contained in their union.
+
+   When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
+certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class.
+Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
+a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
+specify this requirement is with `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.
+
+   Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
+instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
+each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer
+that mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the
+operations for single-byte values (`QImode') are limited to certain
+registers.  When this is so, each register class that is used in a
+bitwise-and or shift instruction must have a subclass consisting of
+registers from which single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This
+is so that `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' can always have a possible value to
+return.
+
+`enum reg_class'
+     An enumeral type that must be defined with all the register class
+     names as enumeral values.  `NO_REGS' must be first.  `ALL_REGS'
+     must be the last register class, followed by one more enumeral
+     value, `LIM_REG_CLASSES', which is not a register class but rather
+     tells how many classes there are.
+
+     Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
+     the class name to type `int'.  The number serves as an index in
+     many of the tables described below.
+
+`N_REG_CLASSES'
+     The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:
+
+          #define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES
+
+`REG_CLASS_NAMES'
+     An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C
+     string constants.  These names are used in writing some of the
+     debugging dumps.
+
+`REG_CLASS_CONTENTS'
+     An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as
+     integers which are bit masks.  The Nth integer specifies the
+     contents of class N.  The way the integer MASK is interpreted is
+     that register R is in the class if `MASK & (1 << R)' is 1.
+
+     When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not
+     suffice.  Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers,
+     braced groupings containing several integers.  Each
+     sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer for the type
+     `HARD_REG_SET' which is defined in `hard-reg-set.h'.
+
+`REGNO_REG_CLASS (REGNO)'
+     A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard
+     register REGNO.  In general there is more than one such class;
+     choose a class which is "minimal", meaning that no smaller class
+     also contains the register.
+
+`BASE_REG_CLASS'
+     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
+     base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an
+     address which is the register value plus a displacement.
+
+`INDEX_REG_CLASS'
+     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
+     index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
+     address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
+     added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).
+
+`REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (CHAR)'
+     A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand
+     constraint letters for register classes.  If CHAR is such a
+     letter, the value should be the register class corresponding to
+     it.  Otherwise, the value should be `NO_REGS'.  The register
+     letter `r', corresponding to class `GENERAL_REGS', will not be
+     passed to this macro; you do not need to handle it.
+
+`REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM)'
+     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
+     for use as a base register in operand addresses.  It may be either
+     a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
+     allocated such a hard register.
+
+`REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM, MODE)'
+     A C expression that is just like `REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that
+     that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
+     MODE.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
+     reference affects whether a register may be used as a base
+     register.  If you define this macro, the compiler will use it
+     instead of `REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.
+
+`REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (NUM)'
+     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
+     for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
+     either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
+     allocated such a hard register.
+
+     The difference between an index register and a base register is
+     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
+     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
+     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
+     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
+     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
+     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
+     both registers only if neither labeling works.
+
+`PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)'
+     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
+     class to use when it is necessary to copy value X into a register
+     in class CLASS.  The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or
+     perhaps another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following
+     definition is safe:
+
+          #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS
+
+     Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.
+     For example, on the 68000, when X is an integer constant that is
+     in range for a `moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is
+     always `DATA_REGS' as long as CLASS includes the data registers.
+     Requiring a data register guarantees that a `moveq' will be used.
+
+     If X is a `const_double', by returning `NO_REGS' you can force X
+     into a memory constant.  This is useful on certain machines where
+     immediate floating values cannot be loaded into certain kinds of
+     registers.
+
+`PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)'
+     Like `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', but for output reloads instead of
+     input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to
+     use CLASS, unchanged.
+
+`LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (MODE, CLASS)'
+     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
+     class to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of
+     mode MODE in a reload register for which class CLASS would
+     ordinarily be used.
+
+     Unlike `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', this macro should be used when
+     there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload
+     classes.
+
+     The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or perhaps another,
+     smaller class.
+
+     Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations
+     which require the macro to do something nontrivial.
+
+`SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
+`SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
+`SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
+     Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly
+     to or from memory or even from other types of registers.  An
+     example is the `MQ' register, which on most machines, can only be
+     copied to or from general registers, but not memory.  Some
+     machines allow copying all registers to and from memory, but
+     require a scratch register for stores to some memory locations
+     (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT, and those with
+     certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling PIC).  In
+     some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
+     required.
+
+     You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase
+     that it may need to allocate at least one register for a reload in
+     addition to the register to contain the data.  Specifically, if
+     copying X to a register CLASS in MODE requires an intermediate
+     register, you should define `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to
+     return the largest register class all of whose registers can be
+     used as intermediate registers or scratch registers.
+
+     If copying a register CLASS in MODE to X requires an intermediate
+     or scratch register, `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' should be
+     defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
+     requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
+     `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' should be used instead of defining both
+     macros identically.
+
+     The values returned by these macros are often `GENERAL_REGS'.
+     Return `NO_REGS' if no spare register is needed; i.e., if X can be
+     directly copied to or from a register of CLASS in MODE without
+     requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this macro if it
+     would always return `NO_REGS'.
+
+     If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
+     intermediate register), you should define patterns for
+     `reload_inM' or `reload_outM', as required (*note Standard
+     Names::..  These patterns, which will normally be implemented with
+     a `define_expand', should be similar to the `movM' patterns,
+     except that operand 2 is the scratch register.
+
+     Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register
+     that contain a single register class.  If the original reload
+     register (whose class is CLASS) can meet the constraint given in
+     the pattern, the value returned by these macros is used for the
+     class of the scratch register.  Otherwise, two additional reload
+     registers are required.  Their classes are obtained from the
+     constraints in the insn pattern.
+
+     X might be a pseudo-register or a `subreg' of a pseudo-register,
+     which could either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use
+     `true_regnum' to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is in
+     memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.
+
+     These macros should not be used in the case where a particular
+     class of registers can only be copied to memory and not to another
+     class of registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are
+     not needed and would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location
+     must be used to perform the copy and the `movM' pattern should use
+     memory as a intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between
+     floating-point and general registers.
+
+`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (CLASS1, CLASS2, M)'
+     Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be
+     copied to some other registers without using memory.  Define this
+     macro on those machines to be a C expression that is non-zero if
+     objects of mode M in registers of CLASS1 can only be copied to
+     registers of class CLASS2 by storing a register of CLASS1 into
+     memory and loading that memory location into a register of CLASS2.
+
+     Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero.
+
+`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_RTX (MODE)'
+     Normally when `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' is defined, the compiler
+     allocates a stack slot for a memory location needed for register
+     copies.  If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the
+     memory location defined by this macro.
+
+     Do not define this macro if you do not define
+     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED'.
+
+`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (MODE)'
+     When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy
+     between two registers of mode MODE, it normally allocates
+     sufficient memory to hold a quantity of `BITS_PER_WORD' bits and
+     performs the store and load operations in a mode that many bits
+     wide and whose class is the same as that of MODE.
+
+     This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that
+     all bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the
+     registers in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for
+     floating-point registers.
+
+     However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines,
+     such as the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point
+     registers differently than in integer registers.  On those
+     machines, the default widening will not work correctly and you
+     must define this macro to suppress that widening in some cases.
+     See the file `alpha.h' for details.
+
+     Do not define this macro if you do not define
+     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' or if widening MODE to a mode that is
+     `BITS_PER_WORD' bits wide is correct for your machine.
+
+`SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES'
+     On some machines, it is risky to let hard registers live across
+     arbitrary insns.  Typically, these machines have instructions that
+     require values to be in specific registers (like an accumulator),
+     and reload will fail if the required hard register is used for
+     another purpose across such an insn.
+
+     Define `SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES' to be an expression with a non-zero
+     value on these machines.  When this macro has a non-zero value, the
+     compiler will try to minimize the lifetime of hard registers.
+
+     It is always safe to define this macro with a non-zero value, but
+     if you unnecessarily define it, you will reduce the amount of
+     optimizations that can be performed in some cases.  If you do not
+     define this macro with a non-zero value when it is required, the
+     compiler will run out of spill registers and print a fatal error
+     message.  For most machines, you should not define this macro at
+     all.
+
+`CLASS_LIKELY_SPILLED_P (CLASS)'
+     A C expression whose value is nonzero if pseudos that have been
+     assigned to registers of class CLASS would likely be spilled
+     because registers of CLASS are needed for spill registers.
+
+     The default value of this macro returns 1 if CLASS has exactly one
+     register and zero otherwise.  On most machines, this default
+     should be used.  Only define this macro to some other expression
+     if pseudos allocated by `local-alloc.c' end up in memory because
+     their hard registers were needed for spill registers.  If this
+     macro returns nonzero for those classes, those pseudos will only
+     be allocated by `global.c', which knows how to reallocate the
+     pseudo to another register.  If there would not be another
+     register available for reallocation, you should not change the
+     definition of this macro since the only effect of such a
+     definition would be to slow down register allocation.
+
+`CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)'
+     A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers of
+     class CLASS needed to hold a value of mode MODE.
+
+     This is closely related to the macro `HARD_REGNO_NREGS'.  In fact,
+     the value of the macro `CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)' should be
+     the maximum value of `HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)' for all
+     REGNO values in the class CLASS.
+
+     This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values in
+     the reload pass.
+
+`CLASS_CANNOT_CHANGE_SIZE'
+     If defined, a C expression for a class that contains registers
+     which the compiler must always access in a mode that is the same
+     size as the mode in which it loaded the register.
+
+     For the example, loading 32-bit integer or floating-point objects
+     into floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64-bits.
+     Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit
+     object does not store the low-order 32-bits, as would be the case
+     for a normal register.  Therefore, `alpha.h' defines this macro as
+     `FLOAT_REGS'.
+
+   Three other special macros describe which operands fit which
+constraint letters.
+
+`CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)'
+     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
+     constraint letters (`I', `J', `K', ... `P') that specify
+     particular ranges of integer values.  If C is one of those
+     letters, the expression should check that VALUE, an integer, is in
+     the appropriate range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is
+     not one of those letters, the value should be 0 regardless of
+     VALUE.
+
+`CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)'
+     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
+     constraint letters that specify particular ranges of
+     `const_double' values (`G' or `H').
+
+     If C is one of those letters, the expression should check that
+     VALUE, an RTX of code `const_double', is in the appropriate range
+     and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is not one of those
+     letters, the value should be 0 regardless of VALUE.
+
+     `const_double' is used for all floating-point constants and for
+     `DImode' fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
+     or both kinds of values.  It can use `GET_MODE' to distinguish
+     between these kinds.
+
+`EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (VALUE, C)'
+     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
+     constraint letters (`Q', `R', `S', `T', `U') that can be used to
+     segregate specific types of operands, usually memory references,
+     for the target machine.  Normally this macro will not be defined.
+     If it is required for a particular target machine, it should
+     return 1 if VALUE corresponds to the operand type represented by
+     the constraint letter C.  If C is not defined as an extra
+     constraint, the value returned should be 0 regardless of VALUE.
+
+     For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their
+     output in r0 if the memory reference contains a symbolic address.
+     Constraint letter `Q' is defined as representing a memory address
+     that does *not* contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is
+     specified with a `Q' constraint on the input and `r' on the
+     output.  The next alternative specifies `m' on the input and a
+     register class that does not include r0 on the output.

+
+Basic Stack Layout
+------------------
+
+   Here is the basic stack layout.
+
+`STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD'
+     Define this macro if pushing a word onto the stack moves the stack
+     pointer to a smaller address.
+
+     When we say, "define this macro if ...," it means that the
+     compiler checks this macro only with `#ifdef' so the precise
+     definition used does not matter.
+
+`FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD'
+     Define this macro if the addresses of local variable slots are at
+     negative offsets from the frame pointer.
+
+`ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD'
+     Define this macro if successive arguments to a function occupy
+     decreasing addresses on the stack.
+
+`STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'
+     Offset from the frame pointer to the first local variable slot to
+     be allocated.
+
+     If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD', find the next slot's offset by
+     subtracting the first slot's length from `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.
+     Otherwise, it is found by adding the length of the first slot to
+     the value `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.
+
+`STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'
+     Offset from the stack pointer register to the first location at
+     which outgoing arguments are placed.  If not specified, the
+     default value of zero is used.  This is the proper value for most
+     machines.
+
+     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
+     the first location at which outgoing arguments are placed.
+
+`FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (FUNDECL)'
+     Offset from the argument pointer register to the first argument's
+     address.  On some machines it may depend on the data type of the
+     function.
+
+     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
+     the first argument's address.
+
+`STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET (FUNDECL)'
+     Offset from the stack pointer register to an item dynamically
+     allocated on the stack, e.g., by `alloca'.
+
+     The default value for this macro is `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET' plus the
+     length of the outgoing arguments.  The default is correct for most
+     machines.  See `function.c' for details.
+
+`DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS (FRAMEADDR)'
+     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address in a
+     stack frame where the pointer to the caller's frame is stored.
+     Assume that FRAMEADDR is an RTL expression for the address of the
+     stack frame itself.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, the default is to return the value
+     of FRAMEADDR--that is, the stack frame address is also the address
+     of the stack word that points to the previous frame.
+
+`SETUP_FRAME_ADDRESSES'
+     If defined, a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
+     to setup the stack so that arbitrary frames can be accessed.  For
+     example, on the Sparc, we must flush all of the register windows
+     to the stack before we can access arbitrary stack frames.  You
+     will seldom need to define this macro.
+
+`BUILTIN_SETJMP_FRAME_VALUE'
+     If defined, a C expression that contains an rtx that is used to
+     store the address of the current frame into the built in `setjmp'
+     buffer.  The default value, `virtual_stack_vars_rtx', is correct
+     for most machines.  One reason you may need to define this macro
+     is if `hard_frame_pointer_rtx' is the appropriate value on your
+     machine.
+
+`RETURN_ADDR_RTX (COUNT, FRAMEADDR)'
+     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the
+     return address for the frame COUNT steps up from the current
+     frame, after the prologue.  FRAMEADDR is the frame pointer of the
+     COUNT frame, or the frame pointer of the COUNT - 1 frame if
+     `RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME' is defined.
+
+     The value of the expression must always be the correct address when
+     COUNT is zero, but may be `NULL_RTX' if there is not way to
+     determine the return address of other frames.
+
+`RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME'
+     Define this if the return address of a particular stack frame is
+     accessed from the frame pointer of the previous stack frame.
+
+`INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX'
+     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the location of the
+     incoming return address at the beginning of any function, before
+     the prologue.  This RTL is either a `REG', indicating that the
+     return value is saved in `REG', or a `MEM' representing a location
+     in the stack.
+
+     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
+     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.
+
+`INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET'
+     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
+     bytes, from the value of the stack pointer register to the top of
+     the stack frame at the beginning of any function, before the
+     prologue.  The top of the frame is defined to be the value of the
+     stack pointer in the previous frame, just before the call
+     instruction.
+
+     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
+     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.
+
+`ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET'
+     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
+     bytes, from the argument pointer to the canonical frame address
+     (cfa).  The final value should coincide with that calculated by
+     `INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET'.  Which is unfortunately not usable
+     during virtual register instantiation.
+
+     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
+     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

+
+Specifying How Stack Checking is Done
+-------------------------------------
+
+   GNU CC will check that stack references are within the boundaries of
+the stack, if the `-fstack-check' is specified, in one of three ways:
+
+  1. If the value of the `STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' macro is nonzero, GNU CC
+     will assume that you have arranged for stack checking to be done at
+     appropriate places in the configuration files, e.g., in
+     `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE'.  GNU CC will do not other special processing.
+
+  2. If `STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' is zero and you defined a named pattern
+     called `check_stack' in your `md' file, GNU CC will call that
+     pattern with one argument which is the address to compare the stack
+     value against.  You must arrange for this pattern to report an
+     error if the stack pointer is out of range.
+
+  3. If neither of the above are true, GNU CC will generate code to
+     periodically "probe" the stack pointer using the values of the
+     macros defined below.
+
+   Normally, you will use the default values of these macros, so GNU CC
+will use the third approach.
+
+`STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN'
+     A nonzero value if stack checking is done by the configuration
+     files in a machine-dependent manner.  You should define this macro
+     if stack checking is require by the ABI of your machine or if you
+     would like to have to stack checking in some more efficient way
+     than GNU CC's portable approach.  The default value of this macro
+     is zero.
+
+`STACK_CHECK_PROBE_INTERVAL'
+     An integer representing the interval at which GNU CC must generate
+     stack probe instructions.  You will normally define this macro to
+     be no larger than the size of the "guard pages" at the end of a
+     stack area.  The default value of 4096 is suitable for most
+     systems.
+
+`STACK_CHECK_PROBE_LOAD'
+     A integer which is nonzero if GNU CC should perform the stack probe
+     as a load instruction and zero if GNU CC should use a store
+     instruction.  The default is zero, which is the most efficient
+     choice on most systems.
+
+`STACK_CHECK_PROTECT'
+     The number of bytes of stack needed to recover from a stack
+     overflow, for languages where such a recovery is supported.  The
+     default value of 75 words should be adequate for most machines.
+
+`STACK_CHECK_MAX_FRAME_SIZE'
+     The maximum size of a stack frame, in bytes.  GNU CC will generate
+     probe instructions in non-leaf functions to ensure at least this
+     many bytes of stack are available.  If a stack frame is larger
+     than this size, stack checking will not be reliable and GNU CC
+     will issue a warning.  The default is chosen so that GNU CC only
+     generates one instruction on most systems.  You should normally
+     not change the default value of this macro.
+
+`STACK_CHECK_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE'
+     GNU CC uses this value to generate the above warning message.  It
+     represents the amount of fixed frame used by a function, not
+     including space for any callee-saved registers, temporaries and
+     user variables.  You need only specify an upper bound for this
+     amount and will normally use the default of four words.
+
+`STACK_CHECK_MAX_VAR_SIZE'
+     The maximum size, in bytes, of an object that GNU CC will place in
+     the fixed area of the stack frame when the user specifies
+     `-fstack-check'.  GNU CC computed the default from the values of
+     the above macros and you will normally not need to override that
+     default.

+
+Registers That Address the Stack Frame
+--------------------------------------
+
+   This discusses registers that address the stack frame.
+
+`STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'
+     The register number of the stack pointer register, which must also
+     be a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS'.  On most
+     machines, the hardware determines which register this is.
+
+`FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'
+     The register number of the frame pointer register, which is used to
+     access automatic variables in the stack frame.  On some machines,
+     the hardware determines which register this is.  On other
+     machines, you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.
+
+`HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'
+     On some machines the offset between the frame pointer and starting
+     offset of the automatic variables is not known until after register
+     allocation has been done (for example, because the saved registers
+     are between these two locations).  On those machines, define
+     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' the number of a special, fixed register to
+     be used internally until the offset is known, and define
+     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' to be the actual hard register number
+     used for the frame pointer.
+
+     You should define this macro only in the very rare circumstances
+     when it is not possible to calculate the offset between the frame
+     pointer and the automatic variables until after register
+     allocation has been completed.  When this macro is defined, you
+     must also indicate in your definition of `ELIMINABLE_REGS' how to
+     eliminate `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' into either
+     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' or `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'.
+
+     Do not define this macro if it would be the same as
+     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'.
+
+`ARG_POINTER_REGNUM'
+     The register number of the arg pointer register, which is used to
+     access the function's argument list.  On some machines, this is
+     the same as the frame pointer register.  On some machines, the
+     hardware determines which register this is.  On other machines,
+     you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.  If this is
+     not the same register as the frame pointer register, then you must
+     mark it as a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS', or
+     arrange to be able to eliminate it (*note Elimination::.).
+
+`RETURN_ADDRESS_POINTER_REGNUM'
+     The register number of the return address pointer register, which
+     is used to access the current function's return address from the
+     stack.  On some machines, the return address is not at a fixed
+     offset from the frame pointer or stack pointer or argument
+     pointer.  This register can be defined to point to the return
+     address on the stack, and then be converted by `ELIMINABLE_REGS'
+     into either the frame pointer or stack pointer.
+
+     Do not define this macro unless there is no other way to get the
+     return address from the stack.
+
+`STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'
+`STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM'
+     Register numbers used for passing a function's static chain
+     pointer.  If register windows are used, the register number as
+     seen by the called function is `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM',
+     while the register number as seen by the calling function is
+     `STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'.  If these registers are the same,
+     `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM' need not be defined.
+
+     The static chain register need not be a fixed register.
+
+     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros should not be
+     defined; instead, the next two macros should be defined.
+
+`STATIC_CHAIN'
+`STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING'
+     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros provide rtx
+     giving `mem' expressions that denote where they are stored.
+     `STATIC_CHAIN' and `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING' give the locations as
+     seen by the calling and called functions, respectively.  Often the
+     former will be at an offset from the stack pointer and the latter
+     at an offset from the frame pointer.
+
+     The variables `stack_pointer_rtx', `frame_pointer_rtx', and
+     `arg_pointer_rtx' will have been initialized prior to the use of
+     these macros and should be used to refer to those items.
+
+     If the static chain is passed in a register, the two previous
+     macros should be defined instead.

+
+Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer
+-----------------------------------------
+
+   This is about eliminating the frame pointer and arg pointer.
+
+`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED'
+     A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a
+     frame pointer.  This expression is evaluated  in the reload pass.
+     If its value is nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.
+
+     The expression can in principle examine the current function and
+     decide according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0
+     or the constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to
+     be generated with no frame pointer, and doing so saves some time
+     or space.  Use 1 when there is no possible advantage to avoiding a
+     frame pointer.
+
+     In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid
+     code without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases
+     and automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of
+     what `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' says.  You don't need to worry about
+     them.
+
+     In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame
+     pointer register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you
+     mark it as a fixed register.  See `FIXED_REGISTERS' for more
+     information.
+
+`INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (DEPTH-VAR)'
+     A C statement to store in the variable DEPTH-VAR the difference
+     between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately
+     after the function prologue.  The value would be computed from
+     information such as the result of `get_frame_size ()' and the
+     tables of registers `regs_ever_live' and `call_used_regs'.
+
+     If `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is defined, this macro will be not be used and
+     need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
+     `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' is defined to always be true; in that
+     case, you may set DEPTH-VAR to anything.
+
+`ELIMINABLE_REGS'
+     If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
+     eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If
+     it is not defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler
+     is to replace references to the frame pointer with references to
+     the stack pointer.
+
+     The definition of this macro is a list of structure
+     initializations, each of which specifies an original and
+     replacement register.
+
+     On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not
+     known until the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a
+     separate hard register must be used for the argument pointer.
+     This register can be eliminated by replacing it with either the
+     frame pointer or the argument pointer, depending on whether or not
+     the frame pointer has been eliminated.
+
+     In this case, you might specify:
+          #define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
+          {{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
+           {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
+           {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}
+
+     Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack
+     pointer is specified first since that is the preferred elimination.
+
+`CAN_ELIMINATE (FROM-REG, TO-REG)'
+     A C expression that returns non-zero if the compiler is allowed to
+     try to replace register number FROM-REG with register number
+     TO-REG.  This macro need only be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
+     defined, and will usually be the constant 1, since most of the
+     cases preventing register elimination are things that the compiler
+     already knows about.
+
+`INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (FROM-REG, TO-REG, OFFSET-VAR)'
+     This macro is similar to `INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET'.  It
+     specifies the initial difference between the specified pair of
+     registers.  This macro must be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
+     defined.
+
+`LONGJMP_RESTORE_FROM_STACK'
+     Define this macro if the `longjmp' function restores registers from
+     the stack frames, rather than from those saved specifically by
+     `setjmp'.  Certain quantities must not be kept in registers across
+     a call to `setjmp' on such machines.

+
+Passing Function Arguments on the Stack
+---------------------------------------
+
+   The macros in this section control how arguments are passed on the
+stack.  See the following section for other macros that control passing
+certain arguments in registers.
+
+`PROMOTE_PROTOTYPES'
+     Define this macro if an argument declared in a prototype as an
+     integral type smaller than `int' should actually be passed as an
+     `int'.  In addition to avoiding errors in certain cases of
+     mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain machines.
+
+`PUSH_ROUNDING (NPUSHED)'
+     A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
+     stack when an instruction attempts to push NPUSHED bytes.
+
+     If the target machine does not have a push instruction, do not
+     define this macro.  That directs GNU CC to use an alternate
+     strategy: to allocate the entire argument block and then store the
+     arguments into it.
+
+     On some machines, the definition
+
+          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)
+
+     will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear to
+     push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
+     alignment.  Then the definition should be
+
+          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) & ~1)
+
+`ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS'
+     If defined, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing
+     arguments will be computed and placed into the variable
+     `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.  No space will be pushed
+     onto the stack for each call; instead, the function prologue should
+     increase the stack frame size by this amount.
+
+     Defining both `PUSH_ROUNDING' and `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is
+     not proper.
+
+`REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (FNDECL)'
+     Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has
+     been allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
+     registers.
+
+     The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
+     reserved for arguments passed in registers for the function
+     represented by FNDECL, which can be zero if GNU CC is calling a
+     library function.
+
+     This space can be allocated by the caller, or be a part of the
+     machine-dependent stack frame: `OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' says
+     which.
+
+`MAYBE_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
+`FINAL_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (CONST_SIZE, VAR_SIZE)'
+     Define these macros in addition to the one above if functions might
+     allocate stack space for arguments even when their values are
+     passed in registers.  These should be used when the stack space
+     allocated for arguments in registers is not a simple constant
+     independent of the function declaration.
+
+     The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
+     that we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments
+     passed in registers.
+
+     The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the
+     area that will be reserved for arguments passed in registers.
+     This takes two arguments: an integer representing the number of
+     bytes of fixed sized arguments on the stack, and a tree
+     representing the number of bytes of variable sized arguments on
+     the stack.
+
+     When these macros are defined, `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' will only be
+     called for libcall functions, the current function, or for a
+     function being called when it is known that such stack space must
+     be allocated.  In each case this value can be easily computed.
+
+     When deciding whether a called function needs such stack space,
+     and how much space to reserve, GNU CC uses these two macros
+     instead of `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'.
+
+`OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
+     Define this if it is the responsibility of the caller to allocate
+     the area reserved for arguments passed in registers.
+
+     If `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, this macro controls
+     whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
+     `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.
+
+`STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA'
+     Define this macro if `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is defined, but the
+     stack parameters don't skip the area specified by it.
+
+     Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is
+     placed on the stack beyond the `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' area.
+     Defining this macro suppresses this behavior and causes the
+     parameter to be passed on the stack in its natural location.
+
+`RETURN_POPS_ARGS (FUNDECL, FUNTYPE, STACK-SIZE)'
+     A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
+     arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the function
+     pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all after
+     the function returns.
+
+     FUNDECL is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
+     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
+     `FUNCTION_DECL' that describes the declaration of the function.
+     From this you can obtain the DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of the
+     function.
+
+     FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
+     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
+     `FUNCTION_TYPE' that describes the data type of the function.
+     From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
+     arguments (if known).
+
+     When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNDECL
+     will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
+     you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can
+     do so by their names.  Note that "library function" in this
+     context means a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is
+     known specially in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C
+     code being compiled.
+
+     STACK-SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
+     stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
+     argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling
+     function.
+
+     On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the
+     definition of this macro is STACK-SIZE.  On the 68000, using the
+     standard calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so
+     the value of the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an
+     alternative calling convention is available in which functions
+     that take a fixed number of arguments pop them but other functions
+     (such as `printf') pop nothing (the caller pops all).  When this
+     convention is in use, FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a
+     function takes a fixed number of arguments.

+
+Passing Arguments in Registers
+------------------------------
+
+   This section describes the macros which let you control how various
+types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
+the stack.
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
+     A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
+     in a register, and which register.
+
+     The arguments are CUM, which summarizes all the previous
+     arguments; MODE, the machine mode of the argument; TYPE, the data
+     type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
+     (which happens for C support library functions); and NAMED, which
+     is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
+     correspond to `...' in the called function's prototype.
+
+     The value of the expression is usually either a `reg' RTX for the
+     hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
+     argument on the stack.
+
+     For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments
+     are pushed, zero suffices as a definition.
+
+     The value of the expression can also be a `parallel' RTX.  This is
+     used when an argument is passed in multiple locations.  The mode
+     of the of the `parallel' should be the mode of the entire
+     argument.  The `parallel' holds any number of `expr_list' pairs;
+     each one describes where part of the argument is passed.  In each
+     `expr_list' the first operand must be a `reg' RTX for the hard
+     register in which to pass this part of the argument, and the mode
+     of the register RTX indicates how large this part of the argument
+     is.  The second operand of the `expr_list' is a `const_int' which
+     gives the offset in bytes into the entire argument of where this
+     part starts.  As a special exception the first `expr_list' in the
+     `parallel' RTX may have a first operand of zero.  This indicates
+     that the bytes starting from the second operand of that
+     `expr_list' are stored on the stack and not held in a register.
+
+     The usual way to make the ANSI library `stdarg.h' work on a machine
+     where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
+     nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
+     by making `FUNCTION_ARG' return 0 whenever NAMED is 0.
+
+     You may use the macro `MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)' in the
+     definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
+     type that must be passed in the stack.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
+     is not defined and `FUNCTION_ARG' returns non-zero for such an
+     argument, the compiler will abort.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is
+     defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then
+     loaded into a register.
+
+`MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)'
+     Define as a C expression that evaluates to nonzero if we do not
+     know how to pass TYPE solely in registers.  The file `expr.h'
+     defines a definition that is usually appropriate, refer to
+     `expr.h' for additional documentation.
+
+`FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
+     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows", so
+     that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
+     necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
+     argument.
+
+     For such machines, `FUNCTION_ARG' computes the register in which
+     the caller passes the value, and `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' should be
+     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function being called
+     where the arguments will arrive.
+
+     If `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' is not defined, `FUNCTION_ARG' serves
+     both purposes.
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
+     A C expression for the number of words, at the beginning of an
+     argument, must be put in registers.  The value must be zero for
+     arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are
+     entirely pushed on the stack.
+
+     On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
+     registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically
+     the first N words of arguments are passed in registers, and the
+     rest on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a `double' or a
+     structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be
+     passed in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells
+     the compiler when this occurs, and how many of the words should go
+     in registers.
+
+     `FUNCTION_ARG' for these arguments should return the first
+     register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
+     `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG', for the called function.
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
+     A C expression that indicates when an argument must be passed by
+     reference.  If nonzero for an argument, a copy of that argument is
+     made in memory and a pointer to the argument is passed instead of
+     the argument itself.  The pointer is passed in whatever way is
+     appropriate for passing a pointer to that type.
+
+     On machines where `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is not defined, a suitable
+     definition of this macro might be
+          #define FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE\
+          (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)  \
+            MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
+     If defined, a C expression that indicates when it is the called
+     function's responsibility to make a copy of arguments passed by
+     invisible reference.  Normally, the caller makes a copy and passes
+     the address of the copy to the routine being called.  When
+     FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES is defined and is nonzero, the caller
+     does not make a copy.  Instead, it passes a pointer to the "live"
+     value.  The called function must not modify this value.  If it can
+     be determined that the value won't be modified, it need not make a
+     copy; otherwise a copy must be made.
+
+`CUMULATIVE_ARGS'
+     A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first
+     argument of `FUNCTION_ARG' and other related values.  For some
+     target machines, the type `int' suffices and can hold the number
+     of bytes of argument so far.
+
+     There is no need to record in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' anything about the
+     arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has
+     other variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on
+     which all arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to
+     store anything in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'; however, the data structure
+     must exist and should not be empty, so use `int'.
+
+`INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME, INDIRECT)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable CUM
+     for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable
+     has type `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.  The value of FNTYPE is the tree node
+     for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or 0
+     if the args are to a compiler support library function.  The value
+     of INDIRECT is nonzero when processing an indirect call, for
+     example a call through a function pointer.  The value of INDIRECT
+     is zero for a call to an explicitly named function, a library
+     function call, or when `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used to find
+     arguments for the function being compiled.
+
+     When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
+     LIBNAME identifies which one.  It is a `symbol_ref' rtx which
+     contains the name of the function, as a string.  LIBNAME is 0 when
+     an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time
+     this macro is called, either LIBNAME or FNTYPE is nonzero, but
+     never both of them at once.
+
+`INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME)'
+     Like `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' but overrides it for the purposes of
+     finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this
+     macro is undefined, `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used instead.
+
+     The value passed for LIBNAME is always 0, since library routines
+     with special calling conventions are never compiled with GNU CC.
+     The argument LIBNAME exists for symmetry with
+     `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the summarizer variable
+     CUM to advance past an argument in the argument list.  The values
+     MODE, TYPE and NAMED describe that argument.  Once this is done,
+     the variable CUM is suitable for analyzing the *following*
+     argument with `FUNCTION_ARG', etc.
+
+     This macro need not do anything if the argument in question was
+     passed on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount
+     of stack space used for arguments without any special help.
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (MODE, TYPE)'
+     If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which
+     direction, to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value
+     should be of type `enum direction': either `upward' to pad above
+     the argument, `downward' to pad below, or `none' to inhibit
+     padding.
+
+     The *amount* of padding is always just enough to reach the next
+     multiple of `FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY'; this macro does not control
+     it.
+
+     This macro has a default definition which is right for most
+     systems.  For little-endian machines, the default is to pad
+     upward.  For big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward
+     for an argument of constant size shorter than an `int', and upward
+     otherwise.
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (MODE, TYPE)'
+     If defined, a C expression that gives the alignment boundary, in
+     bits, of an argument with the specified mode and type.  If it is
+     not defined, `PARM_BOUNDARY' is used for all arguments.
+
+`FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
+     register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This
+     does *not* include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
+     the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
+     used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on
+     the stack.
+
+`LOAD_ARGS_REVERSED'
+     If defined, the order in which arguments are loaded into their
+     respective argument registers is reversed so that the last
+     argument is loaded first.  This macro only effects arguments
+     passed in registers.

+
+How Scalar Function Values Are Returned
+---------------------------------------
+
+   This section discusses the macros that control returning scalars as
+values--values that can fit in registers.
+
+`TRADITIONAL_RETURN_FLOAT'
+     Define this macro if `-traditional' should not cause functions
+     declared to return `float' to convert the value to `double'.
+
+`FUNCTION_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)'
+     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
+     function returns a value of data type VALTYPE.  VALTYPE is a tree
+     node representing a data type.  Write `TYPE_MODE (VALTYPE)' to get
+     the machine mode used to represent that type.  On many machines,
+     only the mode is relevant.  (Actually, on most machines, scalar
+     values are returned in the same place regardless of mode).
+
+     The value of the expression is usually a `reg' RTX for the hard
+     register where the return value is stored.  The value can also be a
+     `parallel' RTX, if the return value is in multiple places.  See
+     `FUNCTION_ARG' for an explanation of the `parallel' form.
+
+     If `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN' is defined, you must apply the same
+     promotion rules specified in `PROMOTE_MODE' if VALTYPE is a scalar
+     type.
+
+     If the precise function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
+     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
+     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
+     for specific functions when all their calls are known.
+
+     `FUNCTION_VALUE' is not used for return vales with aggregate data
+     types, because these are returned in another way.  See
+     `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' and related macros, below.
+
+`FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)'
+     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows" so
+     that the register in which a function returns its value is not the
+     same as the one in which the caller sees the value.
+
+     For such machines, `FUNCTION_VALUE' computes the register in which
+     the caller will see the value.  `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' should be
+     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function where to put the
+     value.
+
+     If `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not defined, `FUNCTION_VALUE'
+     serves both purposes.
+
+     `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not used for return vales with
+     aggregate data types, because these are returned in another way.
+     See `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' and related macros, below.
+
+`LIBCALL_VALUE (MODE)'
+     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
+     library function returns a value of mode MODE.  If the precise
+     function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
+     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
+     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
+     for specific functions when all their calls are known.
+
+     Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
+     support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
+     specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
+     compiled.
+
+     The definition of `LIBRARY_VALUE' need not be concerned aggregate
+     data types, because none of the library functions returns such
+     types.
+
+`FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
+     register in which the values of called function may come back.
+
+     A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as
+     the second of a pair (for a value of type `double', say) need not
+     be recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
+     suffices:
+
+          #define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)
+
+     If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the
+     called function use different registers for the return value, this
+     macro should recognize only the caller's register numbers.
+
+`APPLY_RESULT_SIZE'
+     Define this macro if `untyped_call' and `untyped_return' need more
+     space than is implied by `FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' for saving and
+     restoring an arbitrary return value.

+
+How Large Values Are Returned
+-----------------------------
+
+   When a function value's mode is `BLKmode' (and in some other cases),
+the value is not returned according to `FUNCTION_VALUE' (*note Scalar
+Return::.).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a block of
+memory in which the value should be stored.  This address is called the
+"structure value address".
+
+   This section describes how to control returning structure values in
+memory.
+
+`RETURN_IN_MEMORY (TYPE)'
+     A C expression which can inhibit the returning of certain function
+     values in registers, based on the type of value.  A nonzero value
+     says to return the function value in memory, just as large
+     structures are always returned.  Here TYPE will be a C expression
+     of type `tree', representing the data type of the value.
+
+     Note that values of mode `BLKmode' must be explicitly handled by
+     this macro.  Also, the option `-fpcc-struct-return' takes effect
+     regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is possible to
+     leave the macro undefined; this causes a default definition to be
+     used, whose value is the constant 1 for `BLKmode' values, and 0
+     otherwise.
+
+     Do not use this macro to indicate that structures and unions
+     should always be returned in memory.  You should instead use
+     `DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN' to indicate this.
+
+`DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN'
+     Define this macro to be 1 if all structure and union return values
+     must be in memory.  Since this results in slower code, this should
+     be defined only if needed for compatibility with other compilers
+     or with an ABI.  If you define this macro to be 0, then the
+     conventions used for structure and union return values are decided
+     by the `RETURN_IN_MEMORY' macro.
+
+     If not defined, this defaults to the value 1.
+
+`STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM'
+     If the structure value address is passed in a register, then
+     `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' should be the number of that register.
+
+`STRUCT_VALUE'
+     If the structure value address is not passed in a register, define
+     `STRUCT_VALUE' as an expression returning an RTX for the place
+     where the address is passed.  If it returns 0, the address is
+     passed as an "invisible" first argument.
+
+`STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING_REGNUM'
+     On some architectures the place where the structure value address
+     is found by the called function is not the same place that the
+     caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could
+     be because the function prologue moves it to a different place.
+
+     If the incoming location of the structure value address is in a
+     register, define this macro as the register number.
+
+`STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING'
+     If the incoming location is not a register, then you should define
+     `STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING' as an expression for an RTX for where the
+     called function should find the value.  If it should find the
+     value on the stack, define this to create a `mem' which refers to
+     the frame pointer.  A definition of 0 means that the address is
+     passed as an "invisible" first argument.
+
+`PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN'
+     Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target
+     machine for returning structures and unions is for the called
+     function to return the address of a static variable containing the
+     value.
+
+     Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the
+     caller to pass an address to the subroutine.
+
+     This macro has effect in `-fpcc-struct-return' mode, but it does
+     nothing when you use `-freg-struct-return' mode.

+
+Caller-Saves Register Allocation
+--------------------------------
+
+   If you enable it, GNU CC can save registers around function calls.
+This makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold
+variables that must live across calls.
+
+`DEFAULT_CALLER_SAVES'
+     Define this macro if function calls on the target machine do not
+     preserve any registers; in other words, if `CALL_USED_REGISTERS'
+     has 1 for all registers.  When defined, this macro enables
+     `-fcaller-saves' by default for all optimization levels.  It has
+     no effect for optimization levels 2 and higher, where
+     `-fcaller-saves' is the default.
+
+`CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (REFS, CALLS)'
+     A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider
+     placing a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and
+     saving and restoring it around each function call.  The expression
+     should be 1 when this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, a default is used which is good on
+     most machines: `4 * CALLS < REFS'.
+
+`HARD_REGNO_CALLER_SAVE_MODE (REGNO, NREGS)'
+     A C expression specifying which mode is required for saving NREGS
+     of a pseudo-register in call-clobbered hard register REGNO.  If
+     REGNO is unsuitable for caller save, `VOIDmode' should be
+     returned.  For most machines this macro need not be defined since
+     GCC will select the smallest suitable mode.

+
+Function Entry and Exit
+-----------------------
+
+   This section describes the macros that output function entry
+("prologue") and exit ("epilogue") code.
+
+`FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
+     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry
+     to a function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the
+     stack frame, initializing the frame pointer register, saving
+     registers that must be saved, and allocating SIZE additional bytes
+     of storage for the local variables.  SIZE is an integer.  FILE is
+     a stdio stream to which the assembler code should be output.
+
+     The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by
+     this macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.
+
+     To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the
+     array `regs_ever_live': element R is nonzero if hard register R is
+     used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
+     prologue should save register R, provided it is not one of the
+     call-used registers.  (`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must likewise use
+     `regs_ever_live'.)
+
+     On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code
+     does not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows,
+     even if they are supposed to be preserved by function calls;
+     instead it takes appropriate steps to "push" the register stack,
+     if any non-call-used registers are used in the function.
+
+     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
+     function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
+     pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether
+     a frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
+     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
+     time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  *Note
+     Elimination::.
+
+     The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack
+     space required for the function.  This stack space consists of the
+     regions listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated
+     in the order listed, with the last listed region closest to the
+     top of the stack (the lowest address if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is
+     defined, and the highest address if it is not defined).  You can
+     use a different order for a machine if doing so is more convenient
+     or required for compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where
+     required by standard or by a debugger, there is no reason why the
+     stack layout used by GCC need agree with that used by other
+     compilers for a machine.
+
+        * A region of `current_function_pretend_args_size' bytes of
+          uninitialized space just underneath the first argument
+          arriving on the stack.  (This may not be at the very start of
+          the allocated stack region if the calling sequence has pushed
+          anything else since pushing the stack arguments.  But
+          usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed yet,
+          because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)
+          This region is used on machines where an argument may be
+          passed partly in registers and partly in memory, and, in some
+          cases to support the features in `varargs.h' and `stdargs.h'.
+
+        * An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the
+          function.  The size of this area, which may also include
+          space for such things as the return address and pointers to
+          previous stack frames, is machine-specific and usually
+          depends on which registers have been used in the function.
+          Machines with register windows often do not require a save
+          area.
+
+        * A region of at least SIZE bytes, possibly rounded up to an
+          allocation boundary, to contain the local variables of the
+          function.  On some machines, this region and the save area
+          may occur in the opposite order, with the save area closer to
+          the top of the stack.
+
+        * Optionally, when `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, a
+          region of `current_function_outgoing_args_size' bytes to be
+          used for outgoing argument lists of the function.  *Note
+          Stack Arguments::.
+
+     Normally, it is necessary for the macros `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and
+     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to treat leaf functions specially.  The C
+     variable `current_function_is_leaf' is nonzero for such a function.
+
+`EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'
+     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
+     instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
+     pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
+     adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.
+
+     Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for
+     which frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a
+     final stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer,
+     and the compiler knows this regardless of `EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'.
+
+`EPILOGUE_USES (REGNO)'
+     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers
+     are used by the epilogue or the `return' pattern.  The stack and
+     frame pointer registers are already be assumed to be used as
+     needed.
+
+`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
+     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for exit
+     from a function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the
+     saved registers and stack pointer to their values when the
+     function was called, and returning control to the caller.  This
+     macro takes the same arguments as the macro `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE',
+     and the registers to restore are determined from `regs_ever_live'
+     and `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' in the same way.
+
+     On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the
+     work of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
+     instruction the name `return' and do not define the macro
+     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' at all.
+
+     Do not define a pattern named `return' if you want the
+     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to be used.  If you want the target switches
+     to control whether return instructions or epilogues are used,
+     define a `return' pattern with a validity condition that tests the
+     target switches appropriately.  If the `return' pattern's validity
+     condition is false, epilogues will be used.
+
+     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
+     function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for
+     these two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a
+     frame pointer is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
+     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 when
+     compiling a function that needs a frame pointer.
+
+     Normally, `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat
+     leaf functions specially.  The C variable
+     `current_function_is_leaf' is nonzero for such a function.  *Note
+     Leaf Functions::.
+
+     On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
+     others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020
+     when given `-mrtd' pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
+     number of arguments.
+
+     Your definition of the macro `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' decides which
+     functions pop their own arguments.  `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' needs to
+     know what was decided.  The variable that is called
+     `current_function_pops_args' is the number of bytes of its
+     arguments that a function should pop.  *Note Scalar Return::.
+
+`DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'
+     Define this macro if the function epilogue contains delay slots to
+     which instructions from the rest of the function can be "moved".
+     The definition should be a C expression whose value is an integer
+     representing the number of delay slots there.
+
+`ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY (INSN, N)'
+     A C expression that returns 1 if INSN can be placed in delay slot
+     number N of the epilogue.
+
+     The argument N is an integer which identifies the delay slot now
+     being considered (since different slots may have different rules of
+     eligibility).  It is never negative and is always less than the
+     number of epilogue delay slots (what `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'
+     returns).  If you reject a particular insn for a given delay slot,
+     in principle, it may be reconsidered for a subsequent delay slot.
+     Also, other insns may (at least in principle) be considered for
+     the so far unfilled delay slot.
+
+     The insns accepted to fill the epilogue delay slots are put in an
+     RTL list made with `insn_list' objects, stored in the variable
+     `current_function_epilogue_delay_list'.  The insn for the first
+     delay slot comes first in the list.  Your definition of the macro
+     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' should fill the delay slots by outputting the
+     insns in this list, usually by calling `final_scan_insn'.
+
+     You need not define this macro if you did not define
+     `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (FILE, THUNK_FNDECL, DELTA, FUNCTION)'
+     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for a thunk
+     function, used to implement C++ virtual function calls with
+     multiple inheritance.  The thunk acts as a wrapper around a
+     virtual function, adjusting the implicit object parameter before
+     handing control off to the real function.
+
+     First, emit code to add the integer DELTA to the location that
+     contains the incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument
+     contains a pointer, and is the one used to pass the `this' pointer
+     in C++.  This is the incoming argument *before* the function
+     prologue, e.g. `%o0' on a sparc.  The addition must preserve the
+     values of all other incoming arguments.
+
+     After the addition, emit code to jump to FUNCTION, which is a
+     `FUNCTION_DECL'.  This is a direct pure jump, not a call, and does
+     not touch the return address.  Hence returning from FUNCTION will
+     return to whoever called the current `thunk'.
+
+     The effect must be as if FUNCTION had been called directly with
+     the adjusted first argument.  This macro is responsible for
+     emitting all of the code for a thunk function; `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE'
+     and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' are not invoked.
+
+     The THUNK_FNDECL is redundant.  (DELTA and FUNCTION have already
+     been extracted from it.)  It might possibly be useful on some
+     targets, but probably not.
+
+     If you do not define this macro, the target-independent code in
+     the C++ frontend will generate a less efficient heavyweight thunk
+     that calls FUNCTION instead of jumping to it.  The generic
+     approach does not support varargs.

+
+Generating Code for Profiling
+-----------------------------
+
+   These macros will help you generate code for profiling.
+
+`FUNCTION_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)'
+     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
+     assembler code to call the profiling subroutine `mcount'.  Before
+     calling, the assembler code must load the address of a counter
+     variable into a register where `mcount' expects to find the
+     address.  The name of this variable is `LP' followed by the number
+     LABELNO, so you would generate the name using `LP%d' in a
+     `fprintf'.
+
+     The details of how the address should be passed to `mcount' are
+     determined by your operating system environment, not by GNU CC.  To
+     figure them out, compile a small program for profiling using the
+     system's installed C compiler and look at the assembler code that
+     results.
+
+`PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE'
+     Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come
+     before the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes
+     after.
+
+`FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)'
+     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
+     assembler code to initialize basic-block profiling for the current
+     object module.  The global compile flag `profile_block_flag'
+     distinguishes two profile modes.
+
+    `profile_block_flag != 2'
+          Output code to call the subroutine `__bb_init_func' once per
+          object module, passing it as its sole argument the address of
+          a block allocated in the object module.
+
+          The name of the block is a local symbol made with this
+          statement:
+
+               ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 0);
+
+          Of course, since you are writing the definition of
+          `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' as well as that of this macro,
+          you can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and
+          use the name that you know will result.
+
+          The first word of this block is a flag which will be nonzero
+          if the object module has already been initialized.  So test
+          this word first, and do not call `__bb_init_func' if the flag
+          is nonzero.  BLOCK_OR_LABEL contains a unique number which
+          may be used to generate a label as a branch destination when
+          `__bb_init_func' will not be called.
+
+          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
+          like:
+
+                 cmp (LPBX0),0
+                 bne local_label
+                 parameter1 <- LPBX0
+                 call __bb_init_func
+               local_label:
+
+    `profile_block_flag == 2'
+          Output code to call the subroutine `__bb_init_trace_func' and
+          pass two parameters to it.  The first parameter is the same as
+          for `__bb_init_func'.  The second parameter is the number of
+          the first basic block of the function as given by
+          BLOCK_OR_LABEL.  Note that `__bb_init_trace_func' has to be
+          called, even if the object module has been initialized
+          already.
+
+          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
+          like:
+               parameter1 <- LPBX0
+               parameter2 <- BLOCK_OR_LABEL
+               call __bb_init_trace_func
+
+`BLOCK_PROFILER (FILE, BLOCKNO)'
+     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
+     assembler code to increment the count associated with the basic
+     block number BLOCKNO.  The global compile flag
+     `profile_block_flag' distinguishes two profile modes.
+
+    `profile_block_flag != 2'
+          Output code to increment the counter directly.  Basic blocks
+          are numbered separately from zero within each compilation.
+          The count associated with block number BLOCKNO is at index
+          BLOCKNO in a vector of words; the name of this array is a
+          local symbol made with this statement:
+
+               ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 2);
+
+          Of course, since you are writing the definition of
+          `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' as well as that of this macro,
+          you can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and
+          use the name that you know will result.
+
+          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
+          like:
+
+               inc (LPBX2+4*BLOCKNO)
+
+    `profile_block_flag == 2'
+          Output code to initialize the global structure `__bb' and
+          call the function `__bb_trace_func', which will increment the
+          counter.
+
+          `__bb' consists of two words.  In the first word, the current
+          basic block number, as given by BLOCKNO, has to be stored.  In
+          the second word, the address of a block allocated in the
+          object module has to be stored.  The address is given by the
+          label created with this statement:
+
+               ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 0);
+
+          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
+          like:
+               move BLOCKNO -> (__bb)
+               move LPBX0 -> (__bb+4)
+               call __bb_trace_func
+
+`FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT (FILE)'
+     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE assembler
+     code to call function `__bb_trace_ret'.  The assembler code should
+     only be output if the global compile flag `profile_block_flag' ==
+     2.  This macro has to be used at every place where code for
+     returning from a function is generated (e.g. `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE').
+     Although you have to write the definition of `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'
+     as well, you have to define this macro to tell the compiler, that
+     the proper call to `__bb_trace_ret' is produced.
+
+`MACHINE_STATE_SAVE (ID)'
+     A C statement or compound statement to save all registers, which
+     may be clobbered by a function call, including condition codes.
+     The `asm' statement will be mostly likely needed to handle this
+     task.  Local labels in the assembler code can be concatenated with
+     the string ID, to obtain a unique lable name.
+
+     Registers or condition codes clobbered by `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' or
+     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must be saved in the macros
+     `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER', `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT' and
+     `BLOCK_PROFILER' prior calling `__bb_init_trace_func',
+     `__bb_trace_ret' and `__bb_trace_func' respectively.
+
+`MACHINE_STATE_RESTORE (ID)'
+     A C statement or compound statement to restore all registers,
+     including condition codes, saved by `MACHINE_STATE_SAVE'.
+
+     Registers or condition codes clobbered by `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' or
+     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must be restored in the macros
+     `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER', `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT' and
+     `BLOCK_PROFILER' after calling `__bb_init_trace_func',
+     `__bb_trace_ret' and `__bb_trace_func' respectively.
+
+`BLOCK_PROFILER_CODE'
+     A C function or functions which are needed in the library to
+     support block profiling.

+
+Implementing the Varargs Macros
+===============================
+
+   GNU CC comes with an implementation of `varargs.h' and `stdarg.h'
+that work without change on machines that pass arguments on the stack.
+Other machines require their own implementations of varargs, and the
+two machine independent header files must have conditionals to include
+it.
+
+   ANSI `stdarg.h' differs from traditional `varargs.h' mainly in the
+calling convention for `va_start'.  The traditional implementation
+takes just one argument, which is the variable in which to store the
+argument pointer.  The ANSI implementation of `va_start' takes an
+additional second argument.  The user is supposed to write the last
+named argument of the function here.
+
+   However, `va_start' should not use this argument.  The way to find
+the end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
+below.
+
+`__builtin_saveregs ()'
+     Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in
+     memory so that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ANSI
+     and traditional versions of `va_start' must use
+     `__builtin_saveregs', unless you use `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' (see
+     below) instead.
+
+     On some machines, `__builtin_saveregs' is open-coded under the
+     control of the macro `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  On other machines,
+     it calls a routine written in assembler language, found in
+     `libgcc2.c'.
+
+     Code generated for the call to `__builtin_saveregs' appears at the
+     beginning of the function, as opposed to where the call to
+     `__builtin_saveregs' is written, regardless of what the code is.
+     This is because the registers must be saved before the function
+     starts to use them for its own purposes.
+
+`__builtin_args_info (CATEGORY)'
+     Use this built-in function to find the first anonymous arguments in
+     registers.
+
+     In general, a machine may have several categories of registers
+     used for arguments, each for a particular category of data types.
+     (For example, on some machines, floating-point registers are used
+     for floating-point arguments while other arguments are passed in
+     the general registers.)  To make non-varargs functions use the
+     proper calling convention, you have defined the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'
+     data type to record how many registers in each category have been
+     used so far
+
+     `__builtin_args_info' accesses the same data structure of type
+     `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' after the ordinary argument layout is finished
+     with it, with CATEGORY specifying which word to access.  Thus, the
+     value indicates the first unused register in a given category.
+
+     Normally, you would use `__builtin_args_info' in the implementation
+     of `va_start', accessing each category just once and storing the
+     value in the `va_list' object.  This is because `va_list' will
+     have to update the values, and there is no way to alter the values
+     accessed by `__builtin_args_info'.
+
+`__builtin_next_arg (LASTARG)'
+     This is the equivalent of `__builtin_args_info', for stack
+     arguments.  It returns the address of the first anonymous stack
+     argument, as type `void *'. If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', it returns
+     the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
+     argument.  Use it in `va_start' to initialize the pointer for
+     fetching arguments from the stack.  Also use it in `va_start' to
+     verify that the second parameter LASTARG is the last named argument
+     of the current function.
+
+`__builtin_classify_type (OBJECT)'
+     Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
+     passed in which kind of register, your implementation of `va_arg'
+     has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
+     specified data type is to use `__builtin_classify_type' together
+     with `sizeof' and `__alignof__'.
+
+     `__builtin_classify_type' ignores the value of OBJECT, considering
+     only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what kind of
+     type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.
+
+     The file `typeclass.h' defines an enumeration that you can use to
+     interpret the values of `__builtin_classify_type'.
+
+   These machine description macros help implement varargs:
+
+`EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (ARGS)'
+     If defined, is a C expression that produces the machine-specific
+     code for a call to `__builtin_saveregs'.  This code will be moved
+     to the very beginning of the function, before any parameter access
+     are made.  The return value of this function should be an RTX that
+     contains the value to use as the return of `__builtin_saveregs'.
+
+     The argument ARGS is a `tree_list' containing the arguments that
+     were passed to `__builtin_saveregs'.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, the compiler will output an ordinary
+     call to the library function `__builtin_saveregs'.
+
+`SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (ARGS_SO_FAR, MODE, TYPE, PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE, SECOND_TIME)'
+     This macro offers an alternative to using `__builtin_saveregs' and
+     defining the macro `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  Use it to store the
+     anonymous register arguments into the stack so that all the
+     arguments appear to have been passed consecutively on the stack.
+     Once this is done, you can use the standard implementation of
+     varargs that works for machines that pass all their arguments on
+     the stack.
+
+     The argument ARGS_SO_FAR is the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' data structure,
+     containing the values that obtain after processing of the named
+     arguments.  The arguments MODE and TYPE describe the last named
+     argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.
+
+     The macro implementation should do two things: first, push onto the
+     stack all the argument registers *not* used for the named
+     arguments, and second, store the size of the data thus pushed into
+     the `int'-valued variable whose name is supplied as the argument
+     PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE.  The value that you store here will serve as
+     additional offset for setting up the stack frame.
+
+     Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
+     compile time without knowing their data types,
+     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is only useful on machines that have just
+     a single category of argument register and use it uniformly for
+     all data types.
+
+     If the argument SECOND_TIME is nonzero, it means that the
+     arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.
+     This happens for an inline function, which is not actually
+     compiled until the end of the source file.  The macro
+     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' should not generate any instructions in
+     this case.
+
+`STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING'
+     Define this macro to be a nonzero value if the location where a
+     function argument is passed depends on whether or not it is a
+     named argument.
+
+     This macro controls how the NAMED argument to `FUNCTION_ARG' is
+     set for varargs and stdarg functions.  If this macro returns a
+     nonzero value, the NAMED argument is always true for named
+     arguments, and false for unnamed arguments.  If it returns a value
+     of zero, but `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is defined, then all
+     arguments are treated as named.  Otherwise, all named arguments
+     except the last are treated as named.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it always returns zero.
+
+`PRETEND_OUTGOING_VARARGS_NAMED'
+     If you need to conditionally change ABIs so that one works with
+     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS', but the other works like neither
+     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' nor `STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING' was defined,
+     then define this macro to return nonzero if
+     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is used, zero otherwise.  Otherwise, you
+     should not define this macro.

+
+Trampolines for Nested Functions
+================================
+
+   A "trampoline" is a small piece of code that is created at run time
+when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
+the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
+tell GNU CC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
+trampoline.
+
+   The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a
+constant address into the static chain register, and jump to the real
+address of the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k,
+this requires two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the
+two addresses exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.
+On RISC machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a
+register in two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate
+immediate operands.
+
+   The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the
+variable parts--the static chain value and the function address--into
+the immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
+simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
+proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
+may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
+separately.
+
+`TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (FILE)'
+     A C statement to output, on the stream FILE, assembler code for a
+     block of data that contains the constant parts of a trampoline.
+     This code should not include a label--the label is taken care of
+     automatically.
+
+     If you do not define this macro, it means no template is needed
+     for the target.  Do not define this macro on systems where the
+     block move code to copy the trampoline into place would be larger
+     than the code to generate it on the spot.
+
+`TRAMPOLINE_SECTION'
+     The name of a subroutine to switch to the section in which the
+     trampoline template is to be placed (*note Sections::.).  The
+     default is a value of `readonly_data_section', which places the
+     trampoline in the section containing read-only data.
+
+`TRAMPOLINE_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an
+     integer.
+
+`TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT'
+     Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, the value of `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
+     is used for aligning trampolines.
+
+`INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE (ADDR, FNADDR, STATIC_CHAIN)'
+     A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline.
+     ADDR is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; FNADDR is an RTX
+     for the address of the nested function; STATIC_CHAIN is an RTX for
+     the static chain value that should be passed to the function when
+     it is called.
+
+`ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE (FP)'
+     A C expression to allocate run-time space for a trampoline.  The
+     expression value should be an RTX representing a memory reference
+     to the space for the trampoline.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is
+     allocated as a stack slot.  This default is right for most
+     machines.  The exceptions are machines where it is impossible to
+     execute instructions in the stack area.  On such machines, you may
+     have to implement a separate stack, using this macro in
+     conjunction with `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'.
+
+     FP points to a data structure, a `struct function', which
+     describes the compilation status of the immediate containing
+     function of the function which the trampoline is for.  Normally
+     (when `ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE' is not defined), the stack slot for the
+     trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing function.
+     Other allocation strategies probably must do something analogous
+     with this information.
+
+   Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they
+have separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack
+location fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when
+the program jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.
+
+   Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts
+of the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is
+to make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
+subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
+latter makes initialization faster.
+
+   To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized,
+define the following macros which describe the shape of the cache.
+
+`INSN_CACHE_SIZE'
+     The total size in bytes of the cache.
+
+`INSN_CACHE_LINE_WIDTH'
+     The length in bytes of each cache line.  The cache is divided into
+     cache lines which are disjoint slots, each holding a contiguous
+     chunk of data fetched from memory.  Each time data is brought into
+     the cache, an entire line is read at once.  The data loaded into a
+     cache line is always aligned on a boundary equal to the line size.
+
+`INSN_CACHE_DEPTH'
+     The number of alternative cache lines that can hold any particular
+     memory location.
+
+   Alternatively, if the machine has system calls or instructions to
+clear the instruction cache directly, you can define the following
+macro.
+
+`CLEAR_INSN_CACHE (BEG, END)'
+     If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the *instruction
+     cache* in the specified interval.  If it is not defined, and the
+     macro INSN_CACHE_SIZE is defined, some generic code is generated
+     to clear the cache.  The definition of this macro would typically
+     be a series of `asm' statements.  Both BEG and END are both pointer
+     expressions.
+
+   To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In
+addition, you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill
+an entire cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that
+the beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same
+point in its cache line.  Look in `m68k.h' as a guide.
+
+`TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE'
+     Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do
+     their work.  The macro should expand to a series of `asm'
+     statements which will be compiled with GNU CC.  They go in a
+     library function named `__transfer_from_trampoline'.
+
+     If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a
+     compiled C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so
+     by placing a special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use
+     one `asm' statement to generate an assembler label, and another to
+     make the label global.  Then trampolines can use that label to
+     jump directly to your special assembler code.

+
+Implicit Calls to Library Routines
+==================================
+
+   Here is an explanation of implicit calls to library routines.
+
+`MULSI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
+     multiplication of one signed full-word by another.  If you do not
+     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__mulsi3',
+     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`DIVSI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
+     division of one signed full-word by another.  If you do not define
+     this macro, the default name is used, which is `__divsi3', a
+     function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`UDIVSI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
+     division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If you do not
+     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__udivsi3',
+     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`MODSI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
+     remainder in division of one signed full-word by another.  If you
+     do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
+     `__modsi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`UMODSI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
+     remainder in division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If
+     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
+     `__umodsi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`MULDI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
+     multiplication of one signed double-word by another.  If you do not
+     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__muldi3',
+     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`DIVDI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
+     division of one signed double-word by another.  If you do not
+     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__divdi3', a
+     function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`UDIVDI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
+     division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If you do not
+     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__udivdi3',
+     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`MODDI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
+     remainder in division of one signed double-word by another.  If
+     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
+     `__moddi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`UMODDI3_LIBCALL'
+     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
+     remainder in division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If
+     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
+     `__umoddi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.
+
+`INIT_TARGET_OPTABS'
+     Define this macro as a C statement that declares additional library
+     routines renames existing ones. `init_optabs' calls this macro
+     after initializing all the normal library routines.
+
+`TARGET_EDOM'
+     The value of `EDOM' on the target machine, as a C integer constant
+     expression.  If you don't define this macro, GNU CC does not
+     attempt to deposit the value of `EDOM' into `errno' directly.
+     Look in `/usr/include/errno.h' to find the value of `EDOM' on your
+     system.
+
+     If you do not define `TARGET_EDOM', then compiled code reports
+     domain errors by calling the library function and letting it
+     report the error.  If mathematical functions on your system use
+     `matherr' when there is an error, then you should leave
+     `TARGET_EDOM' undefined so that `matherr' is used normally.
+
+`GEN_ERRNO_RTX'
+     Define this macro as a C expression to create an rtl expression
+     that refers to the global "variable" `errno'.  (On certain systems,
+     `errno' may not actually be a variable.)  If you don't define this
+     macro, a reasonable default is used.
+
+`TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS'
+     Define this macro if GNU CC should generate calls to the System V
+     (and ANSI C) library functions `memcpy' and `memset' rather than
+     the BSD functions `bcopy' and `bzero'.
+
+`LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE'
+     Define this macro if only `float' arguments cannot be passed to
+     library routines (so they must be converted to `double').  This
+     macro affects both how library calls are generated and how the
+     library routines in `libgcc1.c' accept their arguments.  It is
+     useful on machines where floating and fixed point arguments are
+     passed differently, such as the i860.
+
+`FLOAT_ARG_TYPE'
+     Define this macro to override the type used by the library
+     routines to pick up arguments of type `float'.  (By default, they
+     use a union of `float' and `int'.)
+
+     The obvious choice would be `float'--but that won't work with
+     traditional C compilers that expect all arguments declared as
+     `float' to arrive as `double'.  To avoid this conversion, the
+     library routines ask for the value as some other type and then
+     treat it as a `float'.
+
+     On some systems, no other type will work for this.  For these
+     systems, you must use `LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE' instead, to force
+     conversion of the values `double' before they are passed.
+
+`FLOATIFY (PASSED-VALUE)'
+     Define this macro to override the way library routines redesignate
+     a `float' argument as a `float' instead of the type it was passed
+     as.  The default is an expression which takes the `float' field of
+     the union.
+
+`FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE'
+     Define this macro to override the type used by the library
+     routines to return values that ought to have type `float'.  (By
+     default, they use `int'.)
+
+     The obvious choice would be `float'--but that won't work with
+     traditional C compilers gratuitously convert values declared as
+     `float' into `double'.
+
+`INTIFY (FLOAT-VALUE)'
+     Define this macro to override the way the value of a
+     `float'-returning library routine should be packaged in order to
+     return it.  These functions are actually declared to return type
+     `FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE' (normally `int').
+
+     These values can't be returned as type `float' because traditional
+     C compilers would gratuitously convert the value to a `double'.
+
+     A local variable named `intify' is always available when the macro
+     `INTIFY' is used.  It is a union of a `float' field named `f' and
+     a field named `i' whose type is `FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE' or `int'.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, the default definition works by
+     copying the value through that union.
+
+`nongcc_SI_type'
+     Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to
+     `SImode' in the system's own C compiler.
+
+     You need not define this macro if that type is `long int', as it
+     usually is.
+
+`nongcc_word_type'
+     Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to the
+     word_mode in the system's own C compiler.
+
+     You need not define this macro if that type is `long int', as it
+     usually is.
+
+`perform_...'
+     Define these macros to supply explicit C statements to carry out
+     various arithmetic operations on types `float' and `double' in the
+     library routines in `libgcc1.c'.  See that file for a full list of
+     these macros and their arguments.
+
+     On most machines, you don't need to define any of these macros,
+     because the C compiler that comes with the system takes care of
+     doing them.
+
+`NEXT_OBJC_RUNTIME'
+     Define this macro to generate code for Objective C message sending
+     using the calling convention of the NeXT system.  This calling
+     convention involves passing the object, the selector and the
+     method arguments all at once to the method-lookup library function.
+
+     The default calling convention passes just the object and the
+     selector to the lookup function, which returns a pointer to the
+     method.

+
+Addressing Modes
+================
+
+   This is about addressing modes.
+
+`HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'
+     A C expression that is nonzero the machine supports post-increment
+     addressing.
+
+`HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'
+`HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'
+`HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'
+     Similar for other kinds of addressing.
+
+`CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P (X)'
+     A C expression that is 1 if the RTX X is a constant which is a
+     valid address.  On most machines, this can be defined as
+     `CONSTANT_P (X)', but a few machines are more restrictive in which
+     constant addresses are supported.
+
+     `CONSTANT_P' accepts integer-values expressions whose values are
+     not explicitly known, such as `symbol_ref', `label_ref', and
+     `high' expressions and `const' arithmetic expressions, in addition
+     to `const_int' and `const_double' expressions.
+
+`MAX_REGS_PER_ADDRESS'
+     A number, the maximum number of registers that can appear in a
+     valid memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a
+     value equal to the maximum number that `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'
+     would ever accept.
+
+`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, LABEL)'
+     A C compound statement with a conditional `goto LABEL;' executed
+     if X (an RTX) is a legitimate memory address on the target machine
+     for a memory operand of mode MODE.
+
+     It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
+     subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
+     understand.
+
+     This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
+     non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
+     must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
+     allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
+     contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
+     with no hard register must be rejected.
+
+     The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be
+     defined to accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some
+     kind of register is required.
+
+     Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
+     macro define the macro `REG_OK_STRICT'.  You should use an `#ifdef
+     REG_OK_STRICT' conditional to define the strict variant in that
+     case and the non-strict variant otherwise.
+
+     Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes
+     (one for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are
+     typically among the subroutines used to define
+     `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'.  Then only these subroutine macros
+     need have two variants; the higher levels of macros may be the
+     same whether strict or not.
+
+     Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a `symbol_ref'
+     and an integer are stored inside a `const' RTX to mark them as
+     constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
+     specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
+     recognize any `const' as legitimate.
+
+     Usually `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant
+     sums that are not marked with  `const'.  It assumes that a naked
+     `plus' indicates indexing.  If so, then you *must* reject such
+     naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of
+     them will be given to `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.
+
+     On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends
+     on the section that the address refers to.  On these machines,
+     define the macro `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information
+     into the `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  When you see a
+     `const', you will have to look inside it to find the `symbol_ref'
+     in order to determine the section.  *Note Assembler Format::.
+
+     The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
+     beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.
+     Allocate the new name in `saveable_obstack'.  You will have to
+     modify `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to remove and decode the added text
+     and output the name accordingly, and define `STRIP_NAME_ENCODING'
+     to access the original name string.
+
+     You can check the information stored here into the `symbol_ref' in
+     the definitions of the macros `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and
+     `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.
+
+`REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P (X)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
+     valid for use as a base register.  For hard registers, it should
+     always accept those which the hardware permits and reject the
+     others.  Whether the macro accepts or rejects pseudo registers
+     must be controlled by `REG_OK_STRICT' as described above.  This
+     usually requires two variant definitions, of which `REG_OK_STRICT'
+     controls the one actually used.
+
+`REG_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (X, MODE)'
+     A C expression that is just like `REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that
+     that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
+     MODE.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
+     reference affects whether a register may be used as a base
+     register.  If you define this macro, the compiler will use it
+     instead of `REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.
+
+`REG_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (X)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
+     valid for use as an index register.
+
+     The difference between an index register and a base register is
+     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
+     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
+     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
+     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
+     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
+     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
+     both registers only if neither labeling works.
+
+`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (X, OLDX, MODE, WIN)'
+     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X with a valid
+     memory address for an operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C
+     statement label elsewhere in the code; the macro definition may use
+
+          GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, WIN);
+
+     to avoid further processing if the address has become legitimate.
+
+     X will always be the result of a call to `break_out_memory_refs',
+     and OLDX will be the operand that was given to that function to
+     produce X.
+
+     The code generated by this macro should not alter the substructure
+     of X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
+     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.
+
+     It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
+     address.  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.
+     In fact, it is safe for this macro to do nothing.  But often a
+     machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.
+
+`LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS (X, MODE, OPNUM, TYPE, IND_LEVELS, WIN)'
+     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X, which is an
+     address that needs reloading, with a valid memory address for an
+     operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C statement label elsewhere
+     in the code.  It is not necessary to define this macro, but it
+     might be useful for performance reasons.
+
+     For example, on the i386, it is sometimes possible to use a single
+     reload register instead of two by reloading a sum of two pseudo
+     registers into a register.  On the other hand, for number of RISC
+     processors offsets are limited so that often an intermediate
+     address needs to be generated in order to address a stack slot.
+     By defining LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS appropriately, the
+     intermediate addresses generated for adjacent some stack slots can
+     be made identical, and thus be shared.
+
+     *Note*: This macro should be used with caution.  It is necessary
+     to know something of how reload works in order to effectively use
+     this, and it is quite easy to produce macros that build in too
+     much knowledge of reload internals.
+
+     *Note*: This macro must be able to reload an address created by a
+     previous invocation of this macro.  If it fails to handle such
+     addresses then the compiler may generate incorrect code or abort.
+
+     The macro definition should use `push_reload' to indicate parts
+     that need reloading; OPNUM, TYPE and IND_LEVELS are usually
+     suitable to be passed unaltered to `push_reload'.
+
+     The code generated by this macro must not alter the substructure of
+     X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
+     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.  This
+     also applies to parts that you change indirectly by calling
+     `push_reload'.
+
+     The macro definition may use `strict_memory_address_p' to test if
+     the address has become legitimate.
+
+     If you want to change only a part of X, one standard way of doing
+     this is to use `copy_rtx'.  Note, however, that is unshares only a
+     single level of rtl.  Thus, if the part to be changed is not at the
+     top level, you'll need to replace first the top leve It is not
+     necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate address;
+     but often a machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.
+
+`GO_IF_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS (ADDR, LABEL)'
+     A C statement or compound statement with a conditional `goto
+     LABEL;' executed if memory address X (an RTX) can have different
+     meanings depending on the machine mode of the memory reference it
+     is used for or if the address is valid for some modes but not
+     others.
+
+     Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have
+     mode-dependent effects because the amount of the increment or
+     decrement is the size of the operand being addressed.  Some
+     machines have other mode-dependent addresses.  Many RISC machines
+     have no mode-dependent addresses.
+
+     You may assume that ADDR is a valid address for the machine.
+
+`LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P (X)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate constant for
+     an immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume that X
+     satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need not check this.  In fact, `1'
+     is a suitable definition for this macro on machines where anything
+     `CONSTANT_P' is valid.

+
+Condition Code Status
+=====================
+
+   This describes the condition code status.
+
+   The file `conditions.h' defines a variable `cc_status' to describe
+how the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of the
+condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
+variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
+currently based, and several standard flags.
+
+   Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the
+machine description header file.  It can also add additional
+machine-specific information by defining `CC_STATUS_MDEP'.
+
+`CC_STATUS_MDEP'
+     C code for a data type which is used for declaring the `mdep'
+     component of `cc_status'.  It defaults to `int'.
+
+     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.
+
+`CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT'
+     A C expression to initialize the `mdep' field to "empty".  The
+     default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use the
+     field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
+     define this macro to initialize it.
+
+     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.
+
+`NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (EXP, INSN)'
+     A C compound statement to set the components of `cc_status'
+     appropriately for an insn INSN whose body is EXP.  It is this
+     macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
+     code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that
+     explicitly set `(cc0)'.
+
+     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.
+
+     If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
+     other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
+     invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
+     reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
+     registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
+     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' can leave `cc_status' unaltered for such insns.
+     But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code based
+     on location `a4@(102)' and the current insn stores a new value in
+     `a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by this, it will
+     no longer be true that it reflects the contents of `a4@(102)'.
+     Therefore, `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must alter `cc_status' in this case
+     to say that nothing is known about the condition code value.
+
+     The definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must be prepared to deal with
+     the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
+     `parallel' RTXs containing various `reg', `mem' or constants which
+     are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these insns is not
+     sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
+     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' should do when it sees one is just to run
+     `CC_STATUS_INIT'.
+
+     A possible definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' is to call a function
+     that looks at an attribute (*note Insn Attributes::.) named, for
+     example, `cc'.  This avoids having detailed information about
+     patterns in two places, the `md' file and in `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC'.
+
+`EXTRA_CC_MODES'
+     A list of names to be used for additional modes for condition code
+     values in registers (*note Jump Patterns::.).  These names are
+     added to `enum machine_mode' and all have class `MODE_CC'.  By
+     convention, they should start with `CC' and end with `mode'.
+
+     You should only define this macro if your machine does not use
+     `cc0' and only if additional modes are required.
+
+`EXTRA_CC_NAMES'
+     A list of C strings giving the names for the modes listed in
+     `EXTRA_CC_MODES'.  For example, the Sparc defines this macro and
+     `EXTRA_CC_MODES' as
+
+          #define EXTRA_CC_MODES CC_NOOVmode, CCFPmode, CCFPEmode
+          #define EXTRA_CC_NAMES "CC_NOOV", "CCFP", "CCFPE"
+
+     This macro is not required if `EXTRA_CC_MODES' is not defined.
+
+`SELECT_CC_MODE (OP, X, Y)'
+     Returns a mode from class `MODE_CC' to be used when comparison
+     operation code OP is applied to rtx X and Y.  For example, on the
+     Sparc, `SELECT_CC_MODE' is defined as (see *note Jump Patterns::.
+     for a description of the reason for this definition)
+
+          #define SELECT_CC_MODE(OP,X,Y) \
+            (GET_MODE_CLASS (GET_MODE (X)) == MODE_FLOAT          \
+             ? ((OP == EQ || OP == NE) ? CCFPmode : CCFPEmode)    \
+             : ((GET_CODE (X) == PLUS || GET_CODE (X) == MINUS    \
+                 || GET_CODE (X) == NEG) \
+                ? CC_NOOVmode : CCmode))
+
+     You need not define this macro if `EXTRA_CC_MODES' is not defined.
+
+`CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (CODE, OP0, OP1)'
+     One some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but
+     you can convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For
+     example, the Alpha does not have a `GT' comparison, but you can
+     use an `LT' comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.
+
+     On such machines, define this macro to be a C statement to do any
+     required conversions.  CODE is the initial comparison code and OP0
+     and OP1 are the left and right operands of the comparison,
+     respectively.  You should modify CODE, OP0, and OP1 as required.
+
+     GNU CC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this
+     macro is valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a
+     pattern in the `md' file.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it would never change the
+     comparison code or operands.
+
+`REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)'
+     A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
+     comparison whose mode is MODE.  If `SELECT_CC_MODE' can ever
+     return MODE for a floating-point inequality comparison, then
+     `REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)' must be zero.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or
+     if the floating-point format is anything other than
+     `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'.  For example, here is the definition used on
+     the Sparc, where floating-point inequality comparisons are always
+     given `CCFPEmode':
+
+          #define REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE(MODE)  ((MODE) != CCFPEmode)

+
+Describing Relative Costs of Operations
+=======================================
+
+   These macros let you describe the relative speed of various
+operations on the target machine.
+
+`CONST_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
+     A part of a C `switch' statement that describes the relative costs
+     of constant RTL expressions.  It must contain `case' labels for
+     expression codes `const_int', `const', `symbol_ref', `label_ref'
+     and `const_double'.  Each case must ultimately reach a `return'
+     statement to return the relative cost of the use of that kind of
+     constant value in an expression.  The cost may depend on the
+     precise value of the constant, which is available for examination
+     in X, and the rtx code of the expression in which it is contained,
+     found in OUTER_CODE.
+
+     CODE is the expression code--redundant, since it can be obtained
+     with `GET_CODE (X)'.
+
+`RTX_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
+     Like `CONST_COSTS' but applies to nonconstant RTL expressions.
+     This can be used, for example, to indicate how costly a multiply
+     instruction is.  In writing this macro, you can use the construct
+     `COSTS_N_INSNS (N)' to specify a cost equal to N fast
+     instructions.  OUTER_CODE is the code of the expression in which X
+     is contained.
+
+     This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost
+     assumptions are adequate for the target machine.
+
+`DEFAULT_RTX_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
+     This macro, if defined, is called for any case not handled by the
+     `RTX_COSTS' or `CONST_COSTS' macros.  This eliminates the need to
+     put case labels into the macro, but the code, or any functions it
+     calls, must assume that the RTL in X could be of any type that has
+     not already been handled.  The arguments are the same as for
+     `RTX_COSTS', and the macro should execute a return statement giving
+     the cost of any RTL expressions that it can handle.  The default
+     cost calculation is used for any RTL for which this macro does not
+     return a value.
+
+     This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost
+     assumptions are adequate for the target machine.
+
+`ADDRESS_COST (ADDRESS)'
+     An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
+     ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
+     expression and the `CONST_COSTS' values.
+
+     For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation
+     of the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC
+     machines, all instructions normally have the same length and
+     execution time.  Hence all addresses will have equal costs.
+
+     In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
+     with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
+     same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.
+
+     For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
+     register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
+     When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
+     register and memory references will be indirect through that
+     register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
+     containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
+     reference, this will produce an additional instruction and
+     possibly require an additional register.  Proper specification of
+     this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.
+
+     Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.
+
+     ADDRESS need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
+     is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
+     assigned a different cost.
+
+     On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
+     cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
+     defining `ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two registers to
+     be live over a region of code where only one would have been if
+     `ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
+     be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs
+     should probably only be given to addresses with different numbers
+     of registers on machines with lots of registers.
+
+     This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
+     constant.
+
+`REGISTER_MOVE_COST (FROM, TO)'
+     A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
+     FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are expressed using the
+     enumeration values such as `GENERAL_REGS'.  A value of 2 is the
+     default; other values are interpreted relative to that.
+
+     It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
+     same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
+     registers if they are not general registers.
+
+     If reload sees an insn consisting of a single `set' between two
+     hard registers, and if `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
+     classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that
+     the constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than
+     2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You
+     should do this if the `movM' pattern's constraints do not allow
+     such copying.
+
+`MEMORY_MOVE_COST (MODE, CLASS, IN)'
+     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode MODE between a
+     register of class CLASS and memory; IN is zero if the value is to
+     be written to memory, non-zero if it is to be read in.  This cost
+     is relative to those in `REGISTER_MOVE_COST'.  If moving between
+     registers and memory is more expensive than between two registers,
+     you should define this macro to express the relative cost.
+
+     If you do not define this macro, GNU CC uses a default cost of 4
+     plus the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
+     needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to
+     copy between memory and a register of CLASS but the reload
+     mechanism is more complex than copying via an intermediate, define
+     this macro to reflect the actual cost of the move.
+
+     GNU CC defines the function `memory_move_secondary_cost' if
+     secondary reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to
+     copying via a secondary register.  If your machine copies from
+     memory using a secondary register in the conventional way but the
+     default base value of 4 is not correct for your machine, define
+     this macro to add some other value to the result of that function.
+     The arguments to that function are the same as to this macro.
+
+`BRANCH_COST'
+     A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1
+     is the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.
+
+   Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative
+costs, but only that certain actions are more expensive than GNU CC
+would ordinarily expect.
+
+`SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS'
+     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing
+     less than a word of memory (i.e. a `char' or a `short') is no
+     faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
+     require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in
+     cost between byte and (aligned) word loads.
+
+     When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
+     finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a
+     fullword load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes
+     accesses are faster than word accesses, using word accesses is
+     preferable since it may eliminate subsequent memory access if
+     subsequent accesses occur to other fields in the same word of the
+     structure, but to different bytes.
+
+`SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND'
+     Define this macro if zero-extension (of a `char' or `short' to an
+     `int') can be done faster if the destination is a register that is
+     known to be zero.
+
+     If you define this macro, you must have instruction patterns that
+     recognize RTL structures like this:
+
+          (set (strict_low_part (subreg:QI (reg:SI ...) 0)) ...)
+
+     and likewise for `HImode'.
+
+`SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS'
+     Define this macro to be the value 1 if unaligned accesses have a
+     cost many times greater than aligned accesses, for example if they
+     are emulated in a trap handler.
+
+     When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will act as if
+     `STRICT_ALIGNMENT' were non-zero when generating code for block
+     moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be
+     produced.  Therefore, do not set this macro non-zero if unaligned
+     accesses only add a cycle or two to the time for a memory access.
+
+     If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.
+
+`DONT_REDUCE_ADDR'
+     Define this macro to inhibit strength reduction of memory
+     addresses.  (On some machines, such strength reduction seems to do
+     harm rather than good.)
+
+`MOVE_RATIO'
+     The threshold of number of scalar memory-to-memory move insns,
+     *below* which a sequence of insns  should be generated instead of a
+     string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will
+     always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
+     increased code size.
+
+     Note that on machines with no memory-to-memory move insns, this
+     macro denotes the corresponding number of memory-to-memory
+     *sequences*.
+
+     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.
+
+`MOVE_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
+     A C expression used to determine whether `move_by_pieces' will be
+     used to copy a chunk of memory, or whether some other block move
+     mechanism will be used.  Defaults to 1 if `move_by_pieces_ninsns'
+     returns less than `MOVE_RATIO'.
+
+`MOVE_MAX_PIECES'
+     A C expression used by `move_by_pieces' to determine the largest
+     unit a load or store used to copy memory is.  Defaults to
+     `MOVE_MAX'.
+
+`USE_LOAD_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)'
+     A C expression used to determine whether a load postincrement is a
+     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.
+
+`USE_LOAD_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)'
+     A C expression used to determine whether a load postdecrement is a
+     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.
+
+`USE_LOAD_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)'
+     A C expression used to determine whether a load preincrement is a
+     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.
+
+`USE_LOAD_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)'
+     A C expression used to determine whether a load predecrement is a
+     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.
+
+`USE_STORE_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)'
+     A C expression used to determine whether a store postincrement is
+     a good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.
+
+`USE_STORE_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)'
+     A C expression used to determine whether a store postdeccrement is
+     a good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.
+
+`USE_STORE_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)'
+     This macro is used to determine whether a store preincrement is a
+     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.
+
+`USE_STORE_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)'
+     This macro is used to determine whether a store predecrement is a
+     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
+     `HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.
+
+`NO_FUNCTION_CSE'
+     Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
+     function address than to call an address kept in a register.
+
+`NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE'
+     Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call
+     itself with an explicit address than to call an address kept in a
+     register.
+
+`ADJUST_COST (INSN, LINK, DEP_INSN, COST)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer variable COST
+     based on the relationship between INSN that is dependent on
+     DEP_INSN through the dependence LINK.  The default is to make no
+     adjustment to COST.  This can be used for example to specify to
+     the scheduler that an output- or anti-dependence does not incur
+     the same cost as a data-dependence.
+
+`ADJUST_PRIORITY (INSN)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer scheduling
+     priority `INSN_PRIORITY(INSN)'.  Reduce the priority to execute
+     the INSN earlier, increase the priority to execute INSN later.
+     Do not define this macro if you do not need to adjust the
+     scheduling priorities of insns.

+
+Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)
+====================================================
+
+   An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
+data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the "text
+section", which holds instructions and read-only data; the "data
+section", which holds initialized writable data; and the "bss section",
+which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds of
+sections.
+
+   The compiler must tell the assembler when to switch sections.  These
+macros control what commands to output to tell the assembler this.  You
+can also define additional sections.
+
+`TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
+     operation that should precede instructions and read-only data.
+     Normally `".text"' is right.
+
+`DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
+     operation to identify the following data as writable initialized
+     data.  Normally `".data"' is right.
+
+`SHARED_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
+     assembler operation to identify the following data as shared data.
+     If not defined, `DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP' will be used.
+
+`BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
+     assembler operation to identify the following data as
+     uninitialized global data.  If not defined, and neither
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' nor `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are defined,
+     uninitialized global data will be output in the data section if
+     `-fno-common' is passed, otherwise `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' will be
+     used.
+
+`SHARED_BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
+     assembler operation to identify the following data as
+     uninitialized global shared data.  If not defined, and
+     `BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP' is, the latter will be used.
+
+`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
+     assembler operation to identify the following data as
+     initialization code.  If not defined, GNU CC will assume such a
+     section does not exist.
+
+`EXTRA_SECTIONS'
+     A list of names for sections other than the standard two, which are
+     `in_text' and `in_data'.  You need not define this macro on a
+     system with no other sections (that GCC needs to use).
+
+`EXTRA_SECTION_FUNCTIONS'
+     One or more functions to be defined in `varasm.c'.  These
+     functions should do jobs analogous to those of `text_section' and
+     `data_section', for your additional sections.  Do not define this
+     macro if you do not define `EXTRA_SECTIONS'.
+
+`READONLY_DATA_SECTION'
+     On most machines, read-only variables, constants, and jump tables
+     are placed in the text section.  If this is not the case on your
+     machine, this macro should be defined to be the name of a function
+     (either `data_section' or a function defined in `EXTRA_SECTIONS')
+     that switches to the section to be used for read-only items.
+
+     If these items should be placed in the text section, this macro
+     should not be defined.
+
+`SELECT_SECTION (EXP, RELOC)'
+     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
+     for output of EXP.  You can assume that EXP is either a `VAR_DECL'
+     node or a constant of some sort.  RELOC indicates whether the
+     initial value of EXP requires link-time relocations.  Select the
+     section by calling `text_section' or one of the alternatives for
+     other sections.
+
+     Do not define this macro if you put all read-only variables and
+     constants in the read-only data section (usually the text section).
+
+`SELECT_RTX_SECTION (MODE, RTX)'
+     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
+     for output of RTX in mode MODE.  You can assume that RTX is some
+     kind of constant in RTL.  The argument MODE is redundant except in
+     the case of a `const_int' rtx.  Select the section by calling
+     `text_section' or one of the alternatives for other sections.
+
+     Do not define this macro if you put all constants in the read-only
+     data section.
+
+`JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION'
+     Define this macro to be an expression with a non-zero value if jump
+     tables (for `tablejump' insns) should be output in the text
+     section, along with the assembler instructions.  Otherwise, the
+     readonly data section is used.
+
+     This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data
+     section.
+
+`ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (DECL)'
+     Define this macro if references to a symbol must be treated
+     differently depending on something about the variable or function
+     named by the symbol (such as what section it is in).
+
+     The macro definition, if any, is executed immediately after the
+     rtl for DECL has been created and stored in `DECL_RTL (DECL)'.
+     The value of the rtl will be a `mem' whose address is a
+     `symbol_ref'.
+
+     The usual thing for this macro to do is to record a flag in the
+     `symbol_ref' (such as `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG') or to store a modified
+     name string in the `symbol_ref' (if one bit is not enough
+     information).
+
+`STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (VAR, SYM_NAME)'
+     Decode SYM_NAME and store the real name part in VAR, sans the
+     characters that encode section info.  Define this macro if
+     `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' alters the symbol's name string.
+
+`UNIQUE_SECTION_P (DECL)'
+     A C expression which evaluates to true if DECL should be placed
+     into a unique section for some target-specific reason.  If you do
+     not define this macro, the default is `0'.  Note that the flag
+     `-ffunction-sections' will also cause functions to be placed into
+     unique sections.
+
+`UNIQUE_SECTION (DECL, RELOC)'
+     A C statement to build up a unique section name, expressed as a
+     STRING_CST node, and assign it to `DECL_SECTION_NAME (DECL)'.
+     RELOC indicates whether the initial value of EXP requires
+     link-time relocations.  If you do not define this macro, GNU CC
+     will use the symbol name prefixed by `.' as the section name.

+
+Position Independent Code
+=========================
+
+   This section describes macros that help implement generation of
+position independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough
+to generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the macros
+`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS', as well as
+`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS'.  You must modify the definition of `movsi' to do
+something appropriate when the source operand contains a symbolic
+address.  You may also need to alter the handling of switch statements
+so that they use relative addresses.
+
+`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM'
+     The register number of the register used to address a table of
+     static data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is
+     defined by a processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).
+     When this macro is defined, RTL is generated for this register
+     once, as with the stack pointer and frame pointer registers.  If
+     this macro is not defined, it is up to the machine-dependent files
+     to allocate such a register (if necessary).
+
+`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED'
+     Define this macro if the register defined by
+     `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is clobbered by calls.  Do not define
+     this macro if `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is not defined.
+
+`FINALIZE_PIC'
+     By generating position-independent code, when two different
+     programs (A and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of
+     the library can be shared whether or not the library is linked at
+     the same address for both programs.  In some of these
+     environments, position-independent code requires not only the use
+     of different addressing modes, but also special code to enable the
+     use of these addressing modes.
+
+     The `FINALIZE_PIC' macro serves as a hook to emit these special
+     codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but
+     not before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of
+     compiling an inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC
+     prologues being included in functions which used inline functions
+     and were compiled to assembly language.)
+
+`LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (X)'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate immediate
+     operand on the target machine when generating position independent
+     code.  You can assume that X satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need
+     not check this.  You can also assume FLAG_PIC is true, so you need
+     not check it either.  You need not define this macro if all
+     constants (including `SYMBOL_REF') can be immediate operands when
+     generating position independent code.

+
+The Overall Framework of an Assembler File
+------------------------------------------
+
+   This describes the overall framework of an assembler file.
+
+`ASM_FILE_START (STREAM)'
+     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
+     appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.
+
+     Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing
+     `#NO_APP', which is a comment that has no effect on most
+     assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it can save time by not
+     checking for certain assembler constructs.
+
+     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
+     commands; see `attasm.h'.
+
+`ASM_FILE_END (STREAM)'
+     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
+     appropriate text to go at the end of an assembler file.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, the default is to output nothing
+     special at the end of the file.  Most systems don't require any
+     definition.
+
+     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
+     commands; see `attasm.h'.
+
+`ASM_IDENTIFY_GCC (FILE)'
+     A C statement to output assembler commands which will identify the
+     object file as having been compiled with GNU CC (or another GNU
+     compiler).
+
+     If you don't define this macro, the string `gcc_compiled.:' is
+     output.  This string is calculated to define a symbol which, on
+     BSD systems, will never be defined for any other reason.  GDB
+     checks for the presence of this symbol when reading the symbol
+     table of an executable.
+
+     On non-BSD systems, you must arrange communication with GDB in
+     some other fashion.  If GDB is not used on your system, you can
+     define this macro with an empty body.
+
+`ASM_COMMENT_START'
+     A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
+     assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will
+     end at the end of the line.
+
+`ASM_APP_ON'
+     A C string constant for text to be output before each `asm'
+     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
+     `"#APP"', which is a comment that has no effect on most assemblers
+     but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines that
+     follow for all valid assembler constructs.
+
+`ASM_APP_OFF'
+     A C string constant for text to be output after each `asm'
+     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
+     `"#NO_APP"', which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
+     time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler
+     output.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging
+     information which indicates that filename NAME is the current
+     source file to the stdio stream STREAM.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
+     the file format in use is appropriate.
+
+`OUTPUT_QUOTED_STRING (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement to output the string STRING to the stdio stream
+     STREAM.  If you do not call the function `output_quoted_string' in
+     your config files, GNU CC will only call it to output filenames to
+     the assembler source.  So you can use it to canonicalize the format
+     of the filename using this macro.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE)'
+     A C statement to output DBX or SDB debugging information before
+     code for line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio
+     stream STREAM.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
+     information for the debugger in use is appropriate.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (STREAM, STRING)'
+     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to handle a
+     `#ident' directive containing the text STRING.  If this macro is
+     not defined, nothing is output for a `#ident' directive.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME (STREAM, DECL, NAME, RELOC)'
+     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to switch
+     to section NAME for object DECL which is either a `FUNCTION_DECL',
+     a `VAR_DECL' or `NULL_TREE'.  RELOC indicates whether the initial
+     value of EXP requires link-time relocations.  Some target formats
+     do not support arbitrary sections.  Do not define this macro in
+     such cases.
+
+     At present this macro is only used to support section attributes.
+     When this macro is undefined, section attributes are disabled.
+
+`OBJC_PROLOGUE'
+     A C statement to output any assembler statements which are
+     required to precede any Objective C object definitions or message
+     sending.  The statement is executed only when compiling an
+     Objective C program.

+Output of Data
+--------------
+
+   This describes data output.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_LONG_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_THREE_QUARTER_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     instruction to assemble a floating-point constant of `TFmode',
+     `DFmode', `SFmode', `TQFmode', `HFmode', or `QFmode',
+     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  VALUE will be a C expression
+     of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  Macros such as
+     `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' are useful for writing these
+     definitions.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_QUADRUPLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT (STREAM, EXP)'
+`ASM_OUTPUT_CHAR (STREAM, EXP)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     instruction to assemble an integer of 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bytes,
+     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  The argument EXP will be an
+     RTL expression which represents a constant value.  Use
+     `output_addr_const (STREAM, EXP)' to output this value as an
+     assembler expression.
+
+     For sizes larger than `UNITS_PER_WORD', if the action of a macro
+     would be identical to repeatedly calling the macro corresponding to
+     a size of `UNITS_PER_WORD', once for each word, you need not define
+     the macro.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE (STREAM, VALUE)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number VALUE.
+
+`ASM_BYTE_OP'
+     A C string constant giving the pseudo-op to use for a sequence of
+     single-byte constants.  If this macro is not defined, the default
+     is `"byte"'.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (STREAM, PTR, LEN)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     instruction to assemble a string constant containing the LEN bytes
+     at PTR.  PTR will be a C expression of type `char *' and LEN a C
+     expression of type `int'.
+
+     If the assembler has a `.ascii' pseudo-op as found in the Berkeley
+     Unix assembler, do not define the macro `ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII'.
+
+`CONSTANT_POOL_BEFORE_FUNCTION'
+     You may define this macro as a C expression.  You should define the
+     expression to have a non-zero value if GNU CC should output the
+     constant pool for a function before the code for the function, or
+     a zero value if GNU CC should output the constant pool after the
+     function.  If you do not define this macro, the usual case, GNU CC
+     will output the constant pool before the function.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)'
+     A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of
+     the constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the
+     name of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
+     required, it can be obtained via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
+     bytes, of the constant pool that will be written immediately after
+     this call.
+
+     If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro
+     need not be defined.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (FILE, X, MODE, ALIGN, LABELNO, JUMPTO)'
+     A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in
+     the constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro
+     need not do anything for RTL expressions that can be output
+     normally.)
+
+     The argument FILE is the standard I/O stream to output the
+     assembler code on.  X is the RTL expression for the constant to
+     output, and MODE is the machine mode (in case X is a `const_int').
+     ALIGN is the required alignment for the value X; you should
+     output an assembler directive to force this much alignment.
+
+     The argument LABELNO is a number to use in an internal label for
+     the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
+     responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper
+     place.  Here is how to do this:
+
+          ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (FILE, "LC", LABELNO);
+
+     When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
+     `goto' to the label JUMPTO.  This will prevent the same pool entry
+     from being output a second time in the usual manner.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.
+
+`CONSTANT_AFTER_FUNCTION_P (EXP)'
+     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if the
+     constant EXP, of type `tree', should be output after the code for a
+     function.  The compiler will normally output all constants before
+     the function; you need not define this macro if this is OK.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_EPILOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)'
+     A C statement to output assembler commands to at the end of the
+     constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the name
+     of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
+     required, you can obtain it via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
+     bytes, of the constant pool that GNU CC wrote immediately before
+     this call.
+
+     If no constant-pool epilogue is required, the usual case, you need
+     not define this macro.
+
+`IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (C)'
+     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if C is used
+     as a logical line separator by the assembler.
+
+     If you do not define this macro, the default is that only the
+     character `;' is treated as a logical line separator.
+
+`ASM_OPEN_PAREN'
+`ASM_CLOSE_PAREN'
+     These macros are defined as C string constant, describing the
+     syntax in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  The
+     following definitions are correct for most assemblers:
+
+          #define ASM_OPEN_PAREN "("
+          #define ASM_CLOSE_PAREN ")"
+
+   These macros are provided by `real.h' for writing the definitions of
+`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE' and the like:
+
+`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (X, L)'
+`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (X, L)'
+`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (X, L)'
+     These translate X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to the target's
+     floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the
+     array of `long int' whose address is L.  The number of elements in
+     the output array is determined by the size of the desired target
+     floating point data type: 32 bits of it go in each `long int' array
+     element.  Each array element holds 32 bits of the result, even if
+     `long int' is wider than 32 bits on the host machine.
+
+     The array element values are designed so that you can print them
+     out using `fprintf' in the order they should appear in the target
+     machine's memory.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_TO_DECIMAL (X, FORMAT, STRING)'
+     This macro converts X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to a decimal
+     number and stores it as a string into STRING.  You must pass, as
+     STRING, the address of a long enough block of space to hold the
+     result.
+
+     The argument FORMAT is a `printf'-specification that serves as a
+     suggestion for how to format the output string.

+
+Output of Uninitialized Variables
+---------------------------------
+
+   Each of the macros in this section is used to do the whole job of
+outputting a single uninitialized variable.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM the assembler definition of a common-label named NAME whose
+     size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size rounded up
+     to whatever alignment the caller wants.
+
+     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
+     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
+     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.
+
+     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
+     common global variables are output.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
+     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' except takes the required alignment as a
+     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
+     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', and gives you more flexibility in
+     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
+     specified as the number of bits.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
+     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' except that DECL of the variable
+     to be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is not
+     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use
+     it in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' and
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON'.  Define this macro when you need to
+     see the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
+     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', except that it
+     is used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON'
+     will be used.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM the assembler definition of uninitialized global DECL named
+     NAME whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
+     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.
+
+     Try to use function `asm_output_bss' defined in `varasm.c' when
+     defining this macro.  If unable, use the expression `assemble_name
+     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
+     output the additional assembler syntax for defining the name, and
+     a newline.
+
+     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
+     global variables are output.  This macro exists to properly
+     support languages like `c++' which do not have `common' data.
+     However, this macro currently is not defined for all targets.  If
+     this macro and `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are not defined then
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' or `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' or
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON' is used.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
+     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' except takes the required alignment as a
+     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
+     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', and gives you more flexibility in
+     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
+     specified as the number of bits.
+
+     Try to use function `asm_output_aligned_bss' defined in file
+     `varasm.c' when defining this macro.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
+     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', except that it is
+     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' will
+     be used.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM the assembler definition of a local-common-label named NAME
+     whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
+     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.
+
+     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
+     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
+     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.
+
+     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
+     static variables are output.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
+     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' except takes the required alignment as a
+     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
+     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', and gives you more flexibility in
+     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
+     specified as the number of bits.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_LOCAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
+     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL' except that DECL of the variable to
+     be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is not
+     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use
+     it in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_DECL' and
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL'.  Define this macro when you need to see
+     the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
+     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', except that it is
+     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' will
+     be used.

+
+Output and Generation of Labels
+-------------------------------
+
+   This is about outputting labels.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM the assembler definition of a label named NAME.  Use the
+     expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name
+     itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
+     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.
+
+`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of a
+     function which is being defined.  This macro is responsible for
+     outputting the label definition (perhaps using
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL'
+     tree node representing the function.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in
+     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').
+
+`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the size of a function
+     which is being defined.  The argument NAME is the name of the
+     function.  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL' tree node
+     representing the function.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, then the function size is not
+     defined.
+
+`ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of an
+     initialized variable which is being defined.  This macro must
+     output the label definition (perhaps using `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').
+     The argument DECL is the `VAR_DECL' tree node representing the
+     variable.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in
+     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').
+
+`ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (STREAM, DECL, TOPLEVEL, ATEND)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable
+     name once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and
+     thus has had a chance to determine the size of an array when
+     controlled by an initializer.  This is used on systems where it's
+     necessary to declare something about the size of the object.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
+     to do nothing.
+
+`ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME global; that
+     is, available for reference from other files.  Use the expression
+     `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before
+     and after that, output the additional assembler syntax for making
+     that name global, and a newline.
+
+`ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME weak; that is,
+     available for reference from other files but only used if no other
+     definition is available.  Use the expression `assemble_name
+     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
+     output the additional assembler syntax for making that name weak,
+     and a newline.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, GNU CC will not support weak
+     symbols and you should not define the `SUPPORTS_WEAK' macro.
+
+`SUPPORTS_WEAK'
+     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports weak
+     symbols.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, `defaults.h' provides a default
+     definition.  If `ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' is defined, the default
+     definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.  Define this macro if you
+     want to control weak symbol support with a compiler flag such as
+     `-melf'.
+
+`MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to mark DECL to be emitted as a
+     public symbol such that extra copies in multiple translation units
+     will be discarded by the linker.  Define this macro if your object
+     file format provides support for this concept, such as the `COMDAT'
+     section flags in the Microsoft Windows PE/COFF format, and this
+     support requires changes to DECL, such as putting it in a separate
+     section.
+
+`SUPPORTS_ONE_ONLY'
+     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports
+     one-only semantics.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, `varasm.c' provides a default
+     definition.  If `MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY' is defined, the default
+     definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.  Define this macro if you
+     want to control one-only symbol support with a compiler flag, or if
+     setting the `DECL_ONE_ONLY' flag is enough to mark a declaration to
+     be emitted as one-only.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name of an external
+     symbol named NAME which is referenced in this compilation but not
+     defined.  The value of DECL is the tree node for the declaration.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
+     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
+     require anything.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (STREAM, SYMREF)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output on STREAM an assembler
+     pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.  The name
+     of the library function is given by SYMREF, which has type `rtx'
+     and is a `symbol_ref'.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
+     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
+     require anything.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
+     STREAM a reference in assembler syntax to a label named NAME.
+     This should add `_' to the front of the name, if that is customary
+     on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix systems.
+     This macro is used in `assemble_name'.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a label whose
+     name is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.
+
+     It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the
+     labels used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise,
+     certain programs will have name conflicts with internal labels.
+
+     It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table
+     of the object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for
+     labels that should be excluded; on many systems, the letter `L' at
+     the beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
+     convention your system uses, and follow it.
+
+     The usual definition of this macro is as follows:
+
+          fprintf (STREAM, "L%s%d:\n", PREFIX, NUM)
+
+`ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (STRING, PREFIX, NUM)'
+     A C statement to store into the string STRING a label whose name
+     is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.
+
+     This string, when output subsequently by `assemble_name', should
+     produce the output that `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL' would produce
+     with the same PREFIX and NUM.
+
+     If the string begins with `*', then `assemble_name' will output
+     the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
+     `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' to use `*' in this way.  If the
+     string doesn't start with `*', then `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' gets to
+     output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' is also part of your machine description, so
+     you should know what it does on your machine.)
+
+`ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (OUTVAR, NAME, NUMBER)'
+     A C expression to assign to OUTVAR (which is a variable of type
+     `char *') a newly allocated string made from the string NAME and
+     the number NUMBER, with some suitable punctuation added.  Use
+     `alloca' to get space for the string.
+
+     The string will be used as an argument to `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
+     produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose
+     name is NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in
+     valid assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time
+     this macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between
+     similarly-named internal static variables in different scopes.
+
+     Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent
+     any conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow
+     periods or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least
+     one of these between the name and the number will suffice.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
+     which defines (equates) the symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.
+
+     If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
+     correct for most systems.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_DEFINE_LABEL_DIFFERENCE_SYMBOL (STREAM, SYMBOL, HIGH, LOW)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
+     which defines (equates) the symbol SYMBOL to have a value equal to
+     the difference of the two symbols HIGH and LOW, i.e.  HIGH minus
+     LOW.  GNU CC guarantees that the symbols HIGH and LOW are already
+     known by the assembler so that the difference resolves into a
+     constant.
+
+     If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
+     correct for most systems.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
+     which defines (equates) the weak symbol NAME to have the value
+     VALUE.
+
+     Define this macro if the target only supports weak aliases; define
+     ASM_OUTPUT_DEF instead if possible.
+
+`OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (BUF, IS_INST, CLASS_NAME, CAT_NAME, SEL_NAME)'
+     Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
+     Objective C methods.
+
+     The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of
+     the class (e.g. `_1_Foo').  For methods in categories, the name of
+     the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
+     `_1_Foo_Bar').
+
+     These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult
+     since the method's selector is not present in the name.
+     Therefore, particular systems define other ways of computing names.
+
+     BUF is an expression of type `char *' which gives you a buffer in
+     which to store the name; its length is as long as CLASS_NAME,
+     CAT_NAME and SEL_NAME put together, plus 50 characters extra.
+
+     The argument IS_INST specifies whether the method is an instance
+     method or a class method; CLASS_NAME is the name of the class;
+     CAT_NAME is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
+     in a category); and SEL_NAME is the name of the selector.
+
+     On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can
+     use this macro to provide more human-readable names.

+
+How Initialization Functions Are Handled
+----------------------------------------
+
+   The compiled code for certain languages includes "constructors"
+(also called "initialization routines")--functions to initialize data
+in the program when the program is started.  These functions need to be
+called before the program is "started"--that is to say, before `main'
+is called.
+
+   Compiling some languages generates "destructors" (also called
+"termination routines") that should be called when the program
+terminates.
+
+   To make the initialization and termination functions work, the
+compiler must output something in the assembler code to cause those
+functions to be called at the appropriate time.  When you port the
+compiler to a new system, you need to specify how to do this.
+
+   There are two major ways that GCC currently supports the execution of
+initialization and termination functions.  Each way has two variants.
+Much of the structure is common to all four variations.
+
+   The linker must build two lists of these functions--a list of
+initialization functions, called `__CTOR_LIST__', and a list of
+termination functions, called `__DTOR_LIST__'.
+
+   Each list always begins with an ignored function pointer (which may
+hold 0, -1, or a count of the function pointers after it, depending on
+the environment).  This is followed by a series of zero or more function
+pointers to constructors (or destructors), followed by a function
+pointer containing zero.
+
+   Depending on the operating system and its executable file format,
+either `crtstuff.c' or `libgcc2.c' traverses these lists at startup
+time and exit time.  Constructors are called in reverse order of the
+list; destructors in forward order.
+
+   The best way to handle static constructors works only for object file
+formats which provide arbitrarily-named sections.  A section is set
+aside for a list of constructors, and another for a list of destructors.
+Traditionally these are called `.ctors' and `.dtors'.  Each object file
+that defines an initialization function also puts a word in the
+constructor section to point to that function.  The linker accumulates
+all these words into one contiguous `.ctors' section.  Termination
+functions are handled similarly.
+
+   To use this method, you need appropriate definitions of the macros
+`ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' and `ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR'.  Usually you can
+get them by including `svr4.h'.
+
+   When arbitrary sections are available, there are two variants,
+depending upon how the code in `crtstuff.c' is called.  On systems that
+support an "init" section which is executed at program startup, parts
+of `crtstuff.c' are compiled into that section.  The program is linked
+by the `gcc' driver like this:
+
+     ld -o OUTPUT_FILE crtbegin.o ... crtend.o -lgcc
+
+   The head of a function (`__do_global_ctors') appears in the init
+section of `crtbegin.o'; the remainder of the function appears in the
+init section of `crtend.o'.  The linker will pull these two parts of
+the section together, making a whole function.  If any of the user's
+object files linked into the middle of it contribute code, then that
+code will be executed as part of the body of `__do_global_ctors'.
+
+   To use this variant, you must define the `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' macro
+properly.
+
+   If no init section is available, do not define
+`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.  Then `__do_global_ctors' is built into the text
+section like all other functions, and resides in `libgcc.a'.  When GCC
+compiles any function called `main', it inserts a procedure call to
+`__main' as the first executable code after the function prologue.  The
+`__main' function, also defined in `libgcc2.c', simply calls
+`__do_global_ctors'.
+
+   In file formats that don't support arbitrary sections, there are
+again two variants.  In the simplest variant, the GNU linker (GNU `ld')
+and an `a.out' format must be used.  In this case,
+`ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' is defined to produce a `.stabs' entry of type
+`N_SETT', referencing the name `__CTOR_LIST__', and with the address of
+the void function containing the initialization code as its value.  The
+GNU linker recognizes this as a request to add the value to a "set";
+the values are accumulated, and are eventually placed in the executable
+as a vector in the format described above, with a leading (ignored)
+count and a trailing zero element.  `ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR' is handled
+similarly.  Since no init section is available, the absence of
+`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' causes the compilation of `main' to call `__main'
+as above, starting the initialization process.
+
+   The last variant uses neither arbitrary sections nor the GNU linker.
+This is preferable when you want to do dynamic linking and when using
+file formats which the GNU linker does not support, such as `ECOFF'.  In
+this case, `ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' does not produce an `N_SETT'
+symbol; initialization and termination functions are recognized simply
+by their names.  This requires an extra program in the linkage step,
+called `collect2'.  This program pretends to be the linker, for use
+with GNU CC; it does its job by running the ordinary linker, but also
+arranges to include the vectors of initialization and termination
+functions.  These functions are called via `__main' as described above.
+
+   Choosing among these configuration options has been simplified by a
+set of operating-system-dependent files in the `config' subdirectory.
+These files define all of the relevant parameters.  Usually it is
+sufficient to include one into your specific machine-dependent
+configuration file.  These files are:
+
+`aoutos.h'
+     For operating systems using the `a.out' format.
+
+`next.h'
+     For operating systems using the `MachO' format.
+
+`svr3.h'
+     For System V Release 3 and similar systems using `COFF' format.
+
+`svr4.h'
+     For System V Release 4 and similar systems using `ELF' format.
+
+`vms.h'
+     For the VMS operating system.
+
+   The following section describes the specific macros that control and
+customize the handling of initialization and termination functions.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Macros for Initialization,  Next: Instruction Output,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Assembler Format
+
+Macros Controlling Initialization Routines
+------------------------------------------
+
+   Here are the macros that control how the compiler handles
+initialization and termination functions:
+
+`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     If defined, a C string constant for the assembler operation to
+     identify the following data as initialization code.  If not
+     defined, GNU CC will assume such a section does not exist.  When
+     you are using special sections for initialization and termination
+     functions, this macro also controls how `crtstuff.c' and
+     `libgcc2.c' arrange to run the initialization functions.
+
+`HAS_INIT_SECTION'
+     If defined, `main' will not call `__main' as described above.
+     This macro should be defined for systems that control the contents
+     of the init section on a symbol-by-symbol basis, such as OSF/1,
+     and should not be defined explicitly for systems that support
+     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.
+
+`LD_INIT_SWITCH'
+     If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker
+     that the following symbol is an initialization routine.
+
+`LD_FINI_SWITCH'
+     If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker
+     that the following symbol is a finalization routine.
+
+`INVOKE__main'
+     If defined, `main' will call `__main' despite the presence of
+     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.  This macro should be defined for systems
+     where the init section is not actually run automatically, but is
+     still useful for collecting the lists of constructors and
+     destructors.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR (STREAM, NAME)'
+     Define this macro as a C statement to output on the stream STREAM
+     the assembler code to arrange to call the function named NAME at
+     initialization time.
+
+     Assume that NAME is the name of a C function generated
+     automatically by the compiler.  This function takes no arguments.
+     Use the function `assemble_name' to output the name NAME; this
+     performs any system-specific syntactic transformations such as
+     adding an underscore.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output to
+     arrange to call the function.  This is correct when the function
+     will be called in some other manner--for example, by means of the
+     `collect2' program, which looks through the symbol table to find
+     these functions by their names.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR (STREAM, NAME)'
+     This is like `ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' but used for termination
+     functions rather than initialization functions.
+
+     When `ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' and `ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR' are
+     defined, the initializaiton routine generated for the generated
+     object file will have static linkage.
+
+   If your system uses `collect2' as the means of processing
+constructors, then that program normally uses `nm' to scan an object
+file for constructor functions to be called.  On such systems you must
+not define `ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' and `ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR' as the
+object file's initialization routine must have global scope.
+
+   On certain kinds of systems, you can define these macros to make
+`collect2' work faster (and, in some cases, make it work at all):
+
+`OBJECT_FORMAT_COFF'
+     Define this macro if the system uses COFF (Common Object File
+     Format) object files, so that `collect2' can assume this format
+     and scan object files directly for dynamic constructor/destructor
+     functions.
+
+`OBJECT_FORMAT_ROSE'
+     Define this macro if the system uses ROSE format object files, so
+     that `collect2' can assume this format and scan object files
+     directly for dynamic constructor/destructor functions.
+
+     These macros are effective only in a native compiler; `collect2' as
+     part of a cross compiler always uses `nm' for the target machine.
+
+`REAL_NM_FILE_NAME'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant containing the file name
+     to use to execute `nm'.  The default is to search the path
+     normally for `nm'.
+
+     If your system supports shared libraries and has a program to list
+     the dynamic dependencies of a given library or executable, you can
+     define these macros to enable support for running initialization
+     and termination functions in shared libraries:
+
+`LDD_SUFFIX'
+     Define this macro to a C string constant containing the name of the
+     program which lists dynamic dependencies, like `"ldd"' under SunOS
+     4.
+
+`PARSE_LDD_OUTPUT (PTR)'
+     Define this macro to be C code that extracts filenames from the
+     output of the program denoted by `LDD_SUFFIX'.  PTR is a variable
+     of type `char *' that points to the beginning of a line of output
+     from `LDD_SUFFIX'.  If the line lists a dynamic dependency, the
+     code must advance PTR to the beginning of the filename on that
+     line.  Otherwise, it must set PTR to `NULL'.

+
+Output of Assembler Instructions
+--------------------------------
+
+   This describes assembler instruction output.
+
+`REGISTER_NAMES'
+     A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
+     registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what
+     translates register numbers in the compiler into assembler
+     language.
+
+`ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES'
+     If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing
+     a name and a register number.  This macro defines additional names
+     for hard registers, thus allowing the `asm' option in declarations
+     to refer to registers using alternate names.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (STREAM, PTR)'
+     Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
+     requires different names for the machine instructions.
+
+     The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
+     assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream STREAM.  The
+     macro-operand PTR is a variable of type `char *' which points to
+     the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is written
+     in the machine description.  The definition should output the
+     opcode name to STREAM, performing any translation you desire, and
+     increment the variable PTR to point at the end of the opcode so
+     that it will not be output twice.
+
+     In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire
+     opcode name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to
+     process text that includes `%'-sequences to substitute operands,
+     you must take care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to
+     increment PTR over whatever text should not be output normally.
+
+     If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
+     elements of `recog_operand'.
+
+     If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output in
+     the usual way.
+
+`FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (INSN, OPVEC, NOPERANDS)'
+     If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output
+     of assembler code for INSN, to modify the extracted operands so
+     they will be output differently.
+
+     Here the argument OPVEC is the vector containing the operands
+     extracted from INSN, and NOPERANDS is the number of elements of
+     the vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.  The
+     contents of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn
+     template into assembler code, so you can change the assembler
+     output by changing the contents of the vector.
+
+     This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
+     file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently,
+     you can cause a large class of instructions to be output
+     differently (such as with rearranged operands).  Naturally,
+     variations in assembler syntax affecting individual insn patterns
+     ought to be handled by writing conditional output routines in
+     those patterns.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.
+
+`FINAL_PRESCAN_LABEL'
+     If defined, `FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN' will be called on each
+     `CODE_LABEL'.  In that case, OPVEC will be a null pointer and
+     NOPERANDS will be zero.
+
+`PRINT_OPERAND (STREAM, X, CODE)'
+     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
+     assembler syntax for an instruction operand X.  X is an RTL
+     expression.
+
+     CODE is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways of
+     printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
+     printed differently depending on the context.  CODE comes from the
+     `%' specification that was used to request printing of the
+     operand.  If the specification was just `%DIGIT' then CODE is 0;
+     if the specification was `%LTR DIGIT' then CODE is the ASCII code
+     for LTR.
+
+     If X is a register, this macro should print the register's name.
+     The names can be found in an array `reg_names' whose type is `char
+     *[]'.  `reg_names' is initialized from `REGISTER_NAMES'.
+
+     When the machine description has a specification `%PUNCT' (a `%'
+     followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called with a
+     null pointer for X and the punctuation character for CODE.
+
+`PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (CODE)'
+     A C expression which evaluates to true if CODE is a valid
+     punctuation character for use in the `PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  If
+     `PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' is not defined, it means that no
+     punctuation characters (except for the standard one, `%') are used
+     in this way.
+
+`PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (STREAM, X)'
+     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
+     assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory
+     reference whose address is X.  X is an RTL expression.
+
+     On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
+     section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
+     macro `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information into the
+     `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  *Note Assembler
+     Format::.
+
+`DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND(FILE)'
+     A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions
+     have been output.  If necessary, call `dbr_sequence_length' to
+     determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
+     currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to
+     output, or whatever.
+
+     Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful
+     in reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is
+     made explicit (e.g. with white space).
+
+     Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
+     prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e.
+     when the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could
+     be found.)  The variable `final_sequence' is null when not
+     processing a sequence, otherwise it contains the `sequence' rtx
+     being output.
+
+`REGISTER_PREFIX'
+`LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX'
+`USER_LABEL_PREFIX'
+`IMMEDIATE_PREFIX'
+     If defined, C string expressions to be used for the `%R', `%L',
+     `%U', and `%I' options of `asm_fprintf' (see `final.c').  These
+     are useful when a single `md' file must support multiple assembler
+     formats.  In that case, the various `tm.h' files can define these
+     macros differently.
+
+`ASSEMBLER_DIALECT'
+     If your target supports multiple dialects of assembler language
+     (such as different opcodes), define this macro as a C expression
+     that gives the numeric index of the assembler language dialect to
+     use, with zero as the first variant.
+
+     If this macro is defined, you may use constructs of the form
+     `{option0|option1|option2...}' in the output templates of patterns
+     (*note Output Template::.) or in the first argument of
+     `asm_fprintf'.  This construct outputs `option0', `option1' or
+     `option2', etc., if the value of `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is zero, one
+     or two, etc.  Any special characters within these strings retain
+     their usual meaning.
+
+     If you do not define this macro, the characters `{', `|' and `}'
+     do not have any special meaning when used in templates or operands
+     to `asm_fprintf'.
+
+     Define the macros `REGISTER_PREFIX', `LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX',
+     `USER_LABEL_PREFIX' and `IMMEDIATE_PREFIX' if you can express the
+     variations in assembler language syntax with that mechanism.
+     Define `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' and use the `{option0|option1}' syntax
+     if the syntax variant are larger and involve such things as
+     different opcodes or operand order.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_REG_PUSH (STREAM, REGNO)'
+     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
+     push hard register number REGNO onto the stack.  The code need not
+     be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_REG_POP (STREAM, REGNO)'
+     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
+     pop hard register number REGNO off of the stack.  The code need
+     not be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Dispatch Tables,  Next: Exception Region Output,  Prev: Instruction Output,  Up: Assembler Format
+
+Output of Dispatch Tables
+-------------------------
+
+   This concerns dispatch tables.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_DIFF_ELT (STREAM, BODY, VALUE, REL)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     pseudo-instruction to generate a difference between two labels.
+     VALUE and REL are the numbers of two internal labels.  The
+     definitions of these labels are output using
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL', and they must be printed in the same
+     way here.  For example,
+
+          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
+                   VALUE, REL)
+
+     You must provide this macro on machines where the addresses in a
+     dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.  If
+     defined, GNU CC will also use this macro on all machines when
+     producing PIC.  BODY is the body of the ADDR_DIFF_VEC; it is
+     provided so that the mode and flags can be read.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_VEC_ELT (STREAM, VALUE)'
+     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
+     dispatch table are absolute.
+
+     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio
+     stream STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a
+     reference to a label.  VALUE is the number of an internal label
+     whose definition is output using `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.  For
+     example,
+
+          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d\n", VALUE)
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM, TABLE)'
+     Define this if the label before a jump-table needs to be output
+     specially.  The first three arguments are the same as for
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'; the fourth argument is the jump-table
+     which follows (a `jump_insn' containing an `addr_vec' or
+     `addr_diff_vec').
+
+     This feature is used on system V to output a `swbeg' statement for
+     the table.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
+     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (STREAM, NUM, TABLE)'
+     Define this if something special must be output at the end of a
+     jump-table.  The definition should be a C statement to be executed
+     after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
+     the appropriate code to stdio stream STREAM.  The argument TABLE
+     is the jump-table insn, and NUM is the label-number of the
+     preceding label.
+
+     If this macro is not defined, nothing special is output at the end
+     of the jump-table.

+Assembler Commands for Exception Regions
+----------------------------------------
+
+   This describes commands marking the start and the end of an exception
+region.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_EH_REGION_BEG ()'
+     A C expression to output text to mark the start of an exception
+     region.
+
+     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_EH_REGION_END ()'
+     A C expression to output text to mark the end of an exception
+     region.
+
+     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.
+
+`EXCEPTION_SECTION ()'
+     A C expression to switch to the section in which the main
+     exception table is to be placed (*note Sections::.).  The default
+     is a section named `.gcc_except_table' on machines that support
+     named sections via `ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME', otherwise if `-fpic'
+     or `-fPIC' is in effect, the `data_section', otherwise the
+     `readonly_data_section'.
+
+`EH_FRAME_SECTION_ASM_OP'
+     If defined, a C string constant for the assembler operation to
+     switch to the section for exception handling frame unwind
+     information.  If not defined, GNU CC will provide a default
+     definition if the target supports named sections.  `crtstuff.c'
+     uses this macro to switch to the appropriate section.
+
+     You should define this symbol if your target supports DWARF 2 frame
+     unwind information and the default definition does not work.
+
+`OMIT_EH_TABLE ()'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if the normal exception table output
+     should be omitted.
+
+     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.
+
+`EH_TABLE_LOOKUP ()'
+     Alternate runtime support for looking up an exception at runtime
+     and finding the associated handler, if the default method won't
+     work.
+
+     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.
+
+`DOESNT_NEED_UNWINDER'
+     A C expression that decides whether or not the current function
+     needs to have a function unwinder generated for it.  See the file
+     `except.c' for details on when to define this, and how.
+
+`MASK_RETURN_ADDR'
+     An rtx used to mask the return address found via RETURN_ADDR_RTX,
+     so that it does not contain any extraneous set bits in it.
+
+`DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO'
+     Define this macro to 0 if your target supports DWARF 2 frame unwind
+     information, but it does not yet work with exception handling.
+     Otherwise, if your target supports this information (if it defines
+     `INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and either `UNALIGNED_INT_ASM_OP' or
+     `OBJECT_FORMAT_ELF'), GCC will provide a default definition of 1.
+
+     If this macro is defined to 1, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be the
+     default exception handling mechanism; otherwise, setjmp/longjmp
+     will be used by default.
+
+     If this macro is defined to anything, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be
+     used instead of inline unwinders and __unwind_function in the
+     non-setjmp case.

+
+Assembler Commands for Alignment
+--------------------------------
+
+   This describes commands for alignment.
+
+`LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER (LABEL)'
+     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which follows
+     a BARRIER.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
+     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
+     not currently define the macro.
+
+`LOOP_ALIGN (LABEL)'
+     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which follows
+     a NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG note.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
+     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
+     not currently define the macro.
+
+`LABEL_ALIGN (LABEL)'
+     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL.  If
+     LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER / LOOP_ALIGN specify a different
+     alignment, the maximum of the specified values is used.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP (STREAM, NBYTES)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     instruction to advance the location counter by NBYTES bytes.
+     Those bytes should be zero when loaded.  NBYTES will be a C
+     expression of type `int'.
+
+`ASM_NO_SKIP_IN_TEXT'
+     Define this macro if `ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP' should not be used in the
+     text section because it fails to put zeros in the bytes that are
+     skipped.  This is true on many Unix systems, where the pseudo-op
+     to skip bytes produces no-op instructions rather than zeros when
+     used in the text section.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
+     POWER bytes.  POWER will be a C expression of type `int'.
+
+`ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER, MAX_SKIP)'
+     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
+     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
+     POWER bytes, but only if MAX_SKIP or fewer bytes are needed to
+     satisfy the alignment request.  POWER and MAX_SKIP will be a C
+     expression of type `int'.

+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: All Debuggers,  Next: DBX Options,  Up: Debugging Info
+
+Macros Affecting All Debugging Formats
+--------------------------------------
+
+   These macros affect all debugging formats.
+
+`DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)'
+     A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the
+     compiler register number REGNO.  In simple cases, the value of this
+     expression may be REGNO itself.  But sometimes there are some
+     registers that the compiler knows about and DBX does not, or vice
+     versa.  In such cases, some register may need to have one number in
+     the compiler and another for DBX.
+
+     If two registers have consecutive numbers inside GNU CC, and they
+     can be used as a pair to hold a multiword value, then they *must*
+     have consecutive numbers after renumbering with
+     `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER'.  Otherwise, debuggers will be unable to
+     access such a pair, because they expect register pairs to be
+     consecutive in their own numbering scheme.
+
+     If you find yourself defining `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER' in way that
+     does not preserve register pairs, then what you must do instead is
+     redefine the actual register numbering scheme.
+
+`DEBUGGER_AUTO_OFFSET (X)'
+     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
+     automatic variable having address X (an RTL expression).  The
+     default computation assumes that X is based on the frame-pointer
+     and gives the offset from the frame-pointer.  This is required for
+     targets that produce debugging output for DBX or COFF-style
+     debugging output for SDB and allow the frame-pointer to be
+     eliminated when the `-g' options is used.
+
+`DEBUGGER_ARG_OFFSET (OFFSET, X)'
+     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
+     argument having address X (an RTL expression).  The nominal offset
+     is OFFSET.
+
+`PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE'
+     A C expression that returns the type of debugging output GNU CC
+     should produce when the user specifies just `-g'.  Define this if
+     you have arranged for GNU CC to support more than one format of
+     debugging output.  Currently, the allowable values are `DBX_DEBUG',
+     `SDB_DEBUG', `DWARF_DEBUG', `DWARF2_DEBUG', and `XCOFF_DEBUG'.
+
+     When the user specifies `-ggdb', GNU CC normally also uses the
+     value of this macro to select the debugging output format, but
+     with two exceptions.  If `DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO' is defined and
+     `LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2' is not defined, GNU CC uses the
+     value `DWARF2_DEBUG'.  Otherwise, if `DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO' is
+     defined, GNU CC uses `DBX_DEBUG'.
+
+     The value of this macro only affects the default debugging output;
+     the user can always get a specific type of output by using
+     `-gstabs', `-gcoff', `-gdwarf-1', `-gdwarf-2', or `-gxcoff'.
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: DBX Options,  Next: DBX Hooks,  Prev: All Debuggers,  Up: Debugging Info
+
+Specific Options for DBX Output
+-------------------------------
+
+   These are specific options for DBX output.
+
+`DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO'
+     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce debugging output for DBX
+     in response to the `-g' option.
+
+`XCOFF_DEBUGGING_INFO'
+     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce XCOFF format debugging
+     output in response to the `-g' option.  This is a variant of DBX
+     format.
+
+`DEFAULT_GDB_EXTENSIONS'
+     Define this macro to control whether GNU CC should by default
+     generate GDB's extended version of DBX debugging information
+     (assuming DBX-format debugging information is enabled at all).  If
+     you don't define the macro, the default is 1: always generate the
+     extended information if there is any occasion to.
+
+`DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT'
+     Define this macro if all `.stabs' commands should be output while
+     in the text section.
+
+`ASM_STABS_OP'
+     A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead
+     of `.stabs' to define an ordinary debugging symbol.  If you don't
+     define this macro, `.stabs' is used.  This macro applies only to
+     DBX debugging information format.
+
+`ASM_STABD_OP'
+     A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead
+     of `.stabd' to define a debugging symbol whose value is the current
+     location.  If you don't define this macro, `.stabd' is used.  This
+     macro applies only to DBX debugging information format.
+
+`ASM_STABN_OP'
+     A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead
+     of `.stabn' to define a debugging symbol with no name.  If you
+     don't define this macro, `.stabn' is used.  This macro applies
+     only to DBX debugging information format.
+
+`DBX_NO_XREFS'
+     Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the
+     construct `xsTAGNAME'.  On some systems, this construct is used to
+     describe a forward reference to a structure named TAGNAME.  On
+     other systems, this construct is not supported at all.
+
+`DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH'
+     A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
+     continued (split into two separate `.stabs' directives) when it
+     exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
+     operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others,
+     splitting must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining
+     this macro with the value zero.  You can override the default
+     splitting-length by defining this macro as an expression for the
+     length you desire.
+
+`DBX_CONTIN_CHAR'
+     Normally continuation is indicated by adding a `\' character to
+     the end of a `.stabs' string when a continuation follows.  To use
+     a different character instead, define this macro as a character
+     constant for the character you want to use.  Do not define this
+     macro if backslash is correct for your system.
+
+`DBX_STATIC_STAB_DATA_SECTION'
+     Define this macro if it is necessary to go to the data section
+     before outputting the `.stabs' pseudo-op for a non-global static
+     variable.
+
+`DBX_TYPE_DECL_STABS_CODE'
+     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
+     a typedef.  The default is `N_LSYM'.
+
+`DBX_STATIC_CONST_VAR_CODE'
+     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
+     a static variable located in the text section.  DBX format does not
+     provide any "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_FUN'.
+
+`DBX_REGPARM_STABS_CODE'
+     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
+     a parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not provide any
+     "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_RSYM'.
+
+`DBX_REGPARM_STABS_LETTER'
+     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
+     parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not customarily
+     provide any way to do this.  The default is `'P''.
+
+`DBX_MEMPARM_STABS_LETTER'
+     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
+     stack parameter.  The default is `'p''.
+
+`DBX_FUNCTION_FIRST'
+     Define this macro if the DBX information for a function and its
+     arguments should precede the assembler code for the function.
+     Normally, in DBX format, the debugging information entirely
+     follows the assembler code.
+
+`DBX_LBRAC_FIRST'
+     Define this macro if the `N_LBRAC' symbol for a block should
+     precede the debugging information for variables and functions
+     defined in that block.  Normally, in DBX format, the `N_LBRAC'
+     symbol comes first.
+
+`DBX_BLOCKS_FUNCTION_RELATIVE'
+     Define this macro if the value of a symbol describing the scope of
+     a block (`N_LBRAC' or `N_RBRAC') should be relative to the start
+     of the enclosing function.  Normally, GNU C uses an absolute
+     address.
+
+`DBX_USE_BINCL'
+     Define this macro if GNU C should generate `N_BINCL' and `N_EINCL'
+     stabs for included header files, as on Sun systems.  This macro
+     also directs GNU C to output a type number as a pair of a file
+     number and a type number within the file.  Normally, GNU C does not
+     generate `N_BINCL' or `N_EINCL' stabs, and it outputs a single
+     number for a type number.

+
+Open-Ended Hooks for DBX Format
+-------------------------------
+
+   These are hooks for DBX format.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC (STREAM, NAME)'
+     Define this macro to say how to output to STREAM the debugging
+     information for the start of a scope level for variable names.  The
+     argument NAME is the name of an assembler symbol (for use with
+     `assemble_name') whose value is the address where the scope begins.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_RBRAC (STREAM, NAME)'
+     Like `DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC', but for the end of a scope level.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_ENUM (STREAM, TYPE)'
+     Define this macro if the target machine requires special handling
+     to output an enumeration type.  The definition should be a C
+     statement (sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information
+     to STREAM for the type TYPE.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_END (STREAM, FUNCTION)'
+     Define this macro if the target machine requires special output at
+     the end of the debugging information for a function.  The
+     definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to output the
+     appropriate information to STREAM.  FUNCTION is the
+     `FUNCTION_DECL' node for the function.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES (SYMS)'
+     Define this macro if you need to control the order of output of the
+     standard data types at the beginning of compilation.  The argument
+     SYMS is a `tree' which is a chain of all the predefined global
+     symbols, including names of data types.
+
+     Normally, DBX output starts with definitions of the types for
+     integers and characters, followed by all the other predefined
+     types of the particular language in no particular order.
+
+     On some machines, it is necessary to output different particular
+     types first.  To do this, define `DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES' to
+     output those symbols in the necessary order.  Any predefined types
+     that you don't explicitly output will be output afterward in no
+     particular order.
+
+     Be careful not to define this macro so that it works only for C.
+     There are no global variables to access most of the built-in
+     types, because another language may have another set of types.
+     The way to output a particular type is to look through SYMS to see
+     if you can find it.  Here is an example:
+
+          {
+            tree decl;
+            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
+              if (!strcmp (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (DECL_NAME (decl)),
+                           "long int"))
+                dbxout_symbol (decl);
+            ...
+          }
+
+     This does nothing if the expected type does not exist.
+
+     See the function `init_decl_processing' in `c-decl.c' to find the
+     names to use for all the built-in C types.
+
+     Here is another way of finding a particular type:
+
+          {
+            tree decl;
+            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
+              if (TREE_CODE (decl) == TYPE_DECL
+                  && (TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (decl))
+                      == INTEGER_CST)
+                  && TYPE_PRECISION (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == 16
+                  && TYPE_UNSIGNED (TREE_TYPE (decl)))
+          /* This must be `unsigned short'.  */
+                dbxout_symbol (decl);
+            ...
+          }
+
+`NO_DBX_FUNCTION_END'
+     Some stabs encapsulation formats (in particular ECOFF), cannot
+     handle the `.stabs "",N_FUN,,0,0,Lscope-function-1' gdb dbx
+     extention construct.  On those machines, define this macro to turn
+     this feature off without disturbing the rest of the gdb extensions.

+
+File Names in DBX Format
+------------------------
+
+   This describes file names in DBX format.
+
+`DBX_WORKING_DIRECTORY'
+     Define this if DBX wants to have the current directory recorded in
+     each object file.
+
+     Note that the working directory is always recorded if GDB
+     extensions are enabled.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
+     stream STREAM which indicates that file NAME is the main source
+     file--the file specified as the input file for compilation.  This
+     macro is called only once, at the beginning of compilation.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
+     DBX debugging information is appropriate.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
+     stream STREAM which indicates that the current directory during
+     compilation is named NAME.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
+     DBX debugging information is appropriate.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement to output DBX debugging information at the end of
+     compilation of the main source file NAME.
+
+     If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output at the
+     end of compilation, which is correct for most machines.
+
+`DBX_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
+     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
+     stream STREAM which indicates that file NAME is the current source
+     file.  This output is generated each time input shifts to a
+     different source file as a result of `#include', the end of an
+     included file, or a `#line' command.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
+     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

+File: gcc.info,  Node: SDB and DWARF,  Prev: File Names and DBX,  Up: Debugging Info
+
+Macros for SDB and DWARF Output
+-------------------------------
+
+   Here are macros for SDB and DWARF output.
+
+`SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO'
+     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce COFF-style debugging
+     output for SDB in response to the `-g' option.
+
+`DWARF_DEBUGGING_INFO'
+     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce dwarf format debugging
+     output in response to the `-g' option.
+
+`DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO'
+     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce dwarf version 2 format
+     debugging output in response to the `-g' option.
+
+     To support optional call frame debugging information, you must also
+     define `INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and either set
+     `RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P' on the prologue insns if you use RTL for the
+     prologue, or call `dwarf2out_def_cfa' and `dwarf2out_reg_save' as
+     appropriate from `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' if you don't.
+
+`DWARF2_FRAME_INFO'
+     Define this macro to a nonzero value if GNU CC should always output
+     Dwarf 2 frame information.  If `DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO' (*note
+     Exception Region Output::. is nonzero, GNU CC will output this
+     information not matter how you define `DWARF2_FRAME_INFO'.
+
+`LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2'
+     Define this macro if the linker does not work with Dwarf version 2.
+     Normally, if the user specifies only `-ggdb' GNU CC will use Dwarf
+     version 2 if available; this macro disables this.  See the
+     description of the `PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE' macro for more
+     details.
+
+`PUT_SDB_...'
+     Define these macros to override the assembler syntax for the
+     special SDB assembler directives.  See `sdbout.c' for a list of
+     these macros and their arguments.  If the standard syntax is used,
+     you need not define them yourself.
+
+`SDB_DELIM'
+     Some assemblers do not support a semicolon as a delimiter, even
+     between SDB assembler directives.  In that case, define this macro
+     to be the delimiter to use (usually `\n').  It is not necessary to
+     define a new set of `PUT_SDB_OP' macros if this is the only change
+     required.
+
+`SDB_GENERATE_FAKE'
+     Define this macro to override the usual method of constructing a
+     dummy name for anonymous structure and union types.  See
+     `sdbout.c' for more information.
+
+`SDB_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REFERENCES'
+     Define this macro to allow references to unknown structure, union,
+     or enumeration tags to be emitted.  Standard COFF does not allow
+     handling of unknown references, MIPS ECOFF has support for it.
+
+`SDB_ALLOW_FORWARD_REFERENCES'
+     Define this macro to allow references to structure, union, or
+     enumeration tags that have not yet been seen to be handled.  Some
+     assemblers choke if forward tags are used, while some require it.

+
+Cross Compilation and Floating Point
+====================================
+
+   While all modern machines use 2's complement representation for
+integers, there are a variety of representations for floating point
+numbers.  This means that in a cross-compiler the representation of
+floating point numbers in the compiled program may be different from
+that used in the machine doing the compilation.
+
+   Because different representation systems may offer different amounts
+of range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host
+machine's floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point
+constants must be represented in the target machine's format.  This
+means that the cross compiler cannot use `atof' to parse a floating
+point constant; it must have its own special routine to use instead.
+Also, constant folding must emulate the target machine's arithmetic (or
+must not be done at all).
+
+   The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are
+cross compiling between different floating point formats.
+
+   Otherwise, don't define them.  Then default definitions will be set
+up which use `double' as the data type, `==' to test for equality, etc.
+
+   You don't need to worry about how many times you use an operand of
+any of these macros.  The compiler never uses operands which have side
+effects.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_TYPE'
+     A macro for the C data type to be used to hold a floating point
+     value in the target machine's format.  Typically this would be a
+     `struct' containing an array of `int'.
+
+`REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (X, Y)'
+     A macro for a C expression which compares for equality the two
+     values, X and Y, both of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
+
+`REAL_VALUES_LESS (X, Y)'
+     A macro for a C expression which tests whether X is less than Y,
+     both values being of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and interpreted as
+     floating point numbers in the target machine's representation.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_LDEXP (X, SCALE)'
+     A macro for a C expression which performs the standard library
+     function `ldexp', but using the target machine's floating point
+     representation.  Both X and the value of the expression have type
+     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  The second argument, SCALE, is an integer.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_FIX (X)'
+     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
+     target-machine floating point value X to a signed integer.  X has
+     type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_FIX (X)'
+     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
+     target-machine floating point value X to an unsigned integer.  X
+     has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_RNDZINT (X)'
+     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
+     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an integer
+     value (but still as a floating point number).  X has type
+     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_RNDZINT (X)'
+     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
+     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an unsigned
+     integer value (but still represented as a floating point number).
+     X has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_ATOF (STRING, MODE)'
+     A macro for a C expression which converts STRING, an expression of
+     type `char *', into a floating point number in the target machine's
+     representation for mode MODE.  The value has type
+     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
+
+`REAL_INFINITY'
+     Define this macro if infinity is a possible floating point value,
+     and therefore division by 0 is legitimate.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_ISINF (X)'
+     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
+     point value, is infinity.  The value has type `int'.  By default,
+     this is defined to call `isinf'.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (X)'
+     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
+     point value, is a "nan" (not-a-number).  The value has type `int'.
+     By default, this is defined to call `isnan'.
+
+   Define the following additional macros if you want to make floating
+point constant folding work while cross compiling.  If you don't define
+them, cross compilation is still possible, but constant folding will
+not happen for floating point values.
+
+`REAL_ARITHMETIC (OUTPUT, CODE, X, Y)'
+     A macro for a C statement which calculates an arithmetic operation
+     of the two floating point values X and Y, both of type
+     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' in the target machine's representation, to
+     produce a result of the same type and representation which is
+     stored in OUTPUT (which will be a variable).
+
+     The operation to be performed is specified by CODE, a tree code
+     which will always be one of the following: `PLUS_EXPR',
+     `MINUS_EXPR', `MULT_EXPR', `RDIV_EXPR', `MAX_EXPR', `MIN_EXPR'.
+
+     The expansion of this macro is responsible for checking for
+     overflow.  If overflow happens, the macro expansion should execute
+     the statement `return 0;', which indicates the inability to
+     perform the arithmetic operation requested.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (X)'
+     A macro for a C expression which returns the negative of the
+     floating point value X.  Both X and the value of the expression
+     have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and are in the target machine's
+     floating point representation.
+
+     There is no way for this macro to report overflow, since overflow
+     can't happen in the negation operation.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_TRUNCATE (MODE, X)'
+     A macro for a C expression which converts the floating point value
+     X to mode MODE.
+
+     Both X and the value of the expression are in the target machine's
+     floating point representation and have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
+     However, the value should have an appropriate bit pattern to be
+     output properly as a floating constant whose precision accords
+     with mode MODE.
+
+     There is no way for this macro to report overflow.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (LOW, HIGH, X)'
+     A macro for a C expression which converts a floating point value X
+     into a double-precision integer which is then stored into LOW and
+     HIGH, two variables of type INT.
+
+`REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (X, LOW, HIGH, MODE)'
+     A macro for a C expression which converts a double-precision
+     integer found in LOW and HIGH, two variables of type INT, into a
+     floating point value which is then stored into X.  The value is in
+     the target machine's representation for mode MODE and has the type
+     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

+
+Miscellaneous Parameters
+========================
+
+   Here are several miscellaneous parameters.
+
+`PREDICATE_CODES'
+     Define this if you have defined special-purpose predicates in the
+     file `MACHINE.c'.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
+     array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name
+     of a predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For
+     each predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions
+     matched by the predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.
+     Here is an example of two entries in the list for a typical RISC
+     machine:
+
+          #define PREDICATE_CODES \
+            {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
+            {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},
+
+     Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
+     incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by
+     the predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it
+     allows the table built by `genrecog' to be more compact and
+     efficient, thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important
+     predicates to include in the list specified by this macro are
+     those used in the most insn patterns.
+
+`CASE_VECTOR_MODE'
+     An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
+     elements of a jump-table should have.
+
+`CASE_VECTOR_SHORTEN_MODE (MIN_OFFSET, MAX_OFFSET, BODY)'
+     Optional: return the preferred mode for an `addr_diff_vec' when
+     the minimum and maximum offset are known.  If you define this, it
+     enables extra code in branch shortening to deal with
+     `addr_diff_vec'.  To make this work, you also have to define
+     INSN_ALIGN and make the alignment for `addr_diff_vec' explicit.
+     The BODY argument is provided so that the offset_unsigned and scale
+     flags can be updated.
+
+`CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE'
+     Define this macro to be a C expression to indicate when jump-tables
+     should contain relative addresses.  If jump-tables never contain
+     relative addresses, then you need not define this macro.
+
+`CASE_DROPS_THROUGH'
+     Define this if control falls through a `case' insn when the index
+     value is out of range.  This means the specified default-label is
+     actually ignored by the `case' insn proper.
+
+`CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD'
+     Define this to be the smallest number of different values for
+     which it is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of
+     conditional branches.  The default is four for machines with a
+     `casesi' instruction and five otherwise.  This is best for most
+     machines.
+
+`WORD_REGISTER_OPERATIONS'
+     Define this macro if operations between registers with integral
+     mode smaller than a word are always performed on the entire
+     register.  Most RISC machines have this property and most CISC
+     machines do not.
+
+`LOAD_EXTEND_OP (MODE)'
+     Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that
+     read memory in MODE, an integral mode narrower than a word, set the
+     bits outside of MODE to be either the sign-extension or the
+     zero-extension of the data read.  Return `SIGN_EXTEND' for values
+     of MODE for which the insn sign-extends, `ZERO_EXTEND' for which
+     it zero-extends, and `NIL' for other modes.
+
+     This macro is not called with MODE non-integral or with a width
+     greater than or equal to `BITS_PER_WORD', so you may return any
+     value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always
+     return `NIL'.  On machines where this macro is defined, you will
+     normally define it as the constant `SIGN_EXTEND' or `ZERO_EXTEND'.
+
+`SHORT_IMMEDIATES_SIGN_EXTEND'
+     Define this macro if loading short immediate values into registers
+     sign extends.
+
+`IMPLICIT_FIX_EXPR'
+     An alias for a tree code that should be used by default for
+     conversion of floating point values to fixed point.  Normally,
+     `FIX_ROUND_EXPR' is used.
+
+`FIXUNS_TRUNC_LIKE_FIX_TRUNC'
+     Define this macro if the same instructions that convert a floating
+     point number to a signed fixed point number also convert validly
+     to an unsigned one.
+
+`EASY_DIV_EXPR'
+     An alias for a tree code that is the easiest kind of division to
+     compile code for in the general case.  It may be `TRUNC_DIV_EXPR',
+     `FLOOR_DIV_EXPR', `CEIL_DIV_EXPR' or `ROUND_DIV_EXPR'.  These four
+     division operators differ in how they round the result to an
+     integer.  `EASY_DIV_EXPR' is used when it is permissible to use
+     any of those kinds of division and the choice should be made on
+     the basis of efficiency.
+
+`MOVE_MAX'
+     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
+     quickly between memory and registers or between two memory
+     locations.
+
+`MAX_MOVE_MAX'
+     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
+     quickly between memory and registers or between two memory
+     locations.  If this is undefined, the default is `MOVE_MAX'.
+     Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the largest value that
+     `MOVE_MAX' can have at run-time.
+
+`SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED'
+     A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of
+     bits actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to
+     the number of bits needed to represent the size of the object
+     being shifted.  When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will
+     assume that it is safe to omit a sign-extend, zero-extend, and
+     certain bitwise `and' instructions that truncates the count of a
+     shift operation.  On machines that have instructions that act on
+     bitfields at variable positions, which may include `bit test'
+     instructions, a nonzero `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' also enables
+     deletion of truncations of the values that serve as arguments to
+     bitfield instructions.
+
+     If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
+     position (for bitfield operations), or if no variable-position
+     bitfield instructions exist, you should define this macro.
+
+     However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0,
+     truncation only applies to shift operations and not the (real or
+     pretended) bitfield operations.  Define `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' to
+     be zero on such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the `md' file
+     that include the implied truncation of the shift instructions.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it would always have the value
+     of zero.
+
+`TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (OUTPREC, INPREC)'
+     A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
+     "convert" an integer of INPREC bits to one of OUTPREC bits (where
+     OUTPREC is smaller than INPREC) by merely operating on it as if it
+     had only OUTPREC bits.
+
+     On many machines, this expression can be 1.
+
+     When `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
+     modes for which `MODES_TIEABLE_P' is 0, suboptimal code can result.
+     If this is the case, making `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' return 0 in
+     such cases may improve things.
+
+`STORE_FLAG_VALUE'
+     A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison
+     operator with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag
+     instruction (`sCOND') when the condition is true.  This
+     description must apply to *all* the `sCOND' patterns and all the
+     comparison operators whose results have a `MODE_INT' mode.
+
+     A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
+     comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is
+     true and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value
+     indicates which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the
+     comparison is true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the
+     comparison operation, which is given by the mode of the first
+     operand in the `sCOND' pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign
+     bit of `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' be on.  Presently, only those bits are
+     used by the compiler.
+
+     If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
+     generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
+     replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they
+     cause the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are
+     undefined.  For example, on a machine whose comparison operators
+     return an `SImode' value and where `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is defined as
+     `0x80000000', saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
+     expression
+
+          (ne:SI (and:SI X (const_int POWER-OF-2)) (const_int 0))
+
+     can be converted to
+
+          (ashift:SI X (const_int N))
+
+     where N is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
+     tested into the sign bit.
+
+     There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the
+     low-order bit for a true value, but does not guarantee the value
+     of any other bits, but we do not know of any machine that has such
+     an instruction.  If you are trying to port GNU CC to such a
+     machine, include an instruction to perform a logical-and of the
+     result with 1 in the pattern for the comparison operators and let
+     us know (*note How to Report Bugs: Bug Reporting.).
+
+     Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a
+     value from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules
+     to guide the choice of value for `STORE_FLAG_VALUE', and hence the
+     instructions to be used:
+
+        * Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
+          `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
+          "normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for
+          the comparison operators to do so because there may be
+          opportunities to combine the normalization with other
+          operations.
+
+        * For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1
+          being slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and
+          1 preferred on other machines.
+
+        * As a second choice, choose a value of `0x80000001' if
+          instructions exist that set both the sign and low-order bits
+          but do not define the others.
+
+        * Otherwise, use a value of `0x80000000'.
+
+     Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
+     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' and its negation in the same number of
+     instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern
+     for those cases, e.g., one matching
+
+          (set A (neg:M (ne:M B C)))
+
+     Some machines can also perform `and' or `plus' operations on
+     condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
+     `sCOND' insn followed by `and' or `plus'.  On those machines,
+     define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names `incscc' and
+     `decscc', respectively, for the patterns which perform `plus' or
+     `minus' operations on condition code values.  See `rs6000.md' for
+     some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to find such
+     instruction sequences on other machines.
+
+     You need not define `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the machine has no
+     store-flag instructions.
+
+`FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE'
+     A C expression that gives a non-zero floating point value that is
+     returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are
+     true.  Define this macro on machine that have comparison
+     operations that return floating-point values.  If there are no
+     such operations, do not define this macro.
+
+`Pmode'
+     An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  On most machines,
+     define this to be the integer mode corresponding to the width of a
+     hardware pointer; `SImode' on 32-bit machine or `DImode' on 64-bit
+     machines.  On some machines you must define this to be one of the
+     partial integer modes, such as `PSImode'.
+
+     The width of `Pmode' must be at least as large as the value of
+     `POINTER_SIZE'.  If it is not equal, you must define the macro
+     `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED' to specify how pointers are extended to
+     `Pmode'.
+
+`FUNCTION_MODE'
+     An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to
+     functions being called, in `call' RTL expressions.  On most
+     machines this should be `QImode'.
+
+`INTEGRATE_THRESHOLD (DECL)'
+     A C expression for the maximum number of instructions above which
+     the function DECL should not be inlined.  DECL is a
+     `FUNCTION_DECL' node.
+
+     The default definition of this macro is 64 plus 8 times the number
+     of arguments that the function accepts.  Some people think a larger
+     threshold should be used on RISC machines.
+
+`SCCS_DIRECTIVE'
+     Define this if the preprocessor should ignore `#sccs' directives
+     and print no error message.
+
+`NO_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C'
+     Define this macro if the system header files support C++ as well
+     as C.  This macro inhibits the usual method of using system header
+     files in C++, which is to pretend that the file's contents are
+     enclosed in `extern "C" {...}'.
+
+`HANDLE_PRAGMA (GETC, UNGETC, NAME)'
+     Define this macro if you want to implement any pragmas.  If
+     defined, it is a C expression whose value is 1 if the pragma was
+     handled by the macro, zero otherwise.  The argument GETC is a
+     function of type `int (*)(void)' which will return the next
+     character in the input stream, or EOF if no characters are left.
+     The argument UNGETC is a function of type `void (*)(int)' which
+     will push a character back into the input stream.  The argument
+     NAME is the word following #pragma in the input stream.  The input
+     stream pointer will be pointing just beyond the end of this word.
+     The input stream should be left undistrubed if the expression
+     returns zero, otherwise it should be pointing at the next
+     character after the end of the pragma.  Any characters remaining
+     on the line will be ignored.
+
+     It is generally a bad idea to implement new uses of `#pragma'.  The
+     only reason to define this macro is for compatibility with other
+     compilers that do support `#pragma' for the sake of any user
+     programs which already use it.
+
+     If the pragma can be implemented by atttributes then the macro
+     `INSERT_ATTRIBUTES' might be a useful one to define as well.
+
+     Note: older versions of this macro only had two arguments: STREAM
+     and TOKEN.  The macro was changed in order to allow it to work
+     when gcc is built both with and without a cpp library.
+
+`HANDLE_SYSV_PRAGMA'
+     Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want the System V style
+     pragmas `#pragma pack(<n>)' and `#pragma weak <name> [=<value>]'
+     to be supported by gcc.
+
+     The pack pragma specifies the maximum alignment (in bytes) of
+     fields within a structure, in much the same way as the
+     `__aligned__' and `__packed__' `__attribute__'s do.  A pack value
+     of zero resets the behaviour to the default.
+
+     The weak pragma only works if `SUPPORTS_WEAK' and
+     `ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' are defined.  If enabled it allows the creation
+     of specifically named weak labels, optionally with a value.
+
+`HANDLE_PRAGMA_PACK_PUSH_POP'
+     Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want to support the
+     Win32 style pragmas `#pragma pack(push,<n>)' and `#pragma
+     pack(pop)'.  The pack(push,<n>) pragma specifies the maximum
+     alignment (in bytes) of fields within a structure, in much the
+     same way as the `__aligned__' and `__packed__' `__attribute__'s
+     do.  A pack value of zero resets the behaviour to the default.
+     Successive invocations of this pragma cause the previous values to
+     be stacked, so that invocations of `#pragma pack(pop)' will return
+     to the previous value.
+
+`VALID_MACHINE_DECL_ATTRIBUTE (DECL, ATTRIBUTES, IDENTIFIER, ARGS)'
+     If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if IDENTIFIER
+     with arguments ARGS is a valid machine specific attribute for DECL.
+     The attributes in ATTRIBUTES have previously been assigned to DECL.
+
+`VALID_MACHINE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE (TYPE, ATTRIBUTES, IDENTIFIER, ARGS)'
+     If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if IDENTIFIER
+     with arguments ARGS is a valid machine specific attribute for TYPE.
+     The attributes in ATTRIBUTES have previously been assigned to TYPE.
+
+`COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (TYPE1, TYPE2)'
+     If defined, a C expression whose value is zero if the attributes on
+     TYPE1 and TYPE2 are incompatible, one if they are compatible, and
+     two if they are nearly compatible (which causes a warning to be
+     generated).
+
+`SET_DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (TYPE)'
+     If defined, a C statement that assigns default attributes to newly
+     defined TYPE.
+
+`MERGE_MACHINE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (TYPE1, TYPE2)'
+     Define this macro if the merging of type attributes needs special
+     handling.  If defined, the result is a list of the combined
+     TYPE_ATTRIBUTES of TYPE1 and TYPE2.  It is assumed that comptypes
+     has already been called and returned 1.
+
+`MERGE_MACHINE_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (OLDDECL, NEWDECL)'
+     Define this macro if the merging of decl attributes needs special
+     handling.  If defined, the result is a list of the combined
+     DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of OLDDECL and NEWDECL.  NEWDECL is a
+     duplicate declaration of OLDDECL.  Examples of when this is needed
+     are when one attribute overrides another, or when an attribute is
+     nullified by a subsequent definition.
+
+`INSERT_ATTRIBUTES (NODE, ATTR_PTR, PREFIX_PTR)'
+     Define this macro if you want to be able to add attributes to a
+     decl when it is being created.  This is normally useful for
+     backends which wish to implement a pragma by using the attributes
+     which correspond to the pragma's effect.  The NODE argument is the
+     decl which is being created.  The ATTR_PTR argument is a pointer
+     to the attribute list for this decl.  The PREFIX_PTR is a pointer
+     to the list of attributes that have appeared after the specifiers
+     and modifiers of the declaration, but before the declaration
+     proper.
+
+`SET_DEFAULT_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (DECL, ATTRIBUTES)'
+     If defined, a C statement that assigns default attributes to newly
+     defined DECL.
+
+`DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS'
+     Define this macro to control use of the character `$' in identifier
+     names.  0 means `$' is not allowed by default; 1 means it is
+     allowed.  1 is the default; there is no need to define this macro
+     in that case.  This macro controls the compiler proper; it does
+     not affect the preprocessor.
+
+`NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL'
+     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
+     `$' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in
+     G++ have `$' in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined, `.' is
+     used instead.
+
+`NO_DOT_IN_LABEL'
+     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
+     `.' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
+     have names that use `.'.  If this macro is defined, these names
+     are rewritten to avoid `.'.
+
+`DEFAULT_MAIN_RETURN'
+     Define this macro if the target system expects every program's
+     `main' function to return a standard "success" value by default
+     (if no other value is explicitly returned).
+
+     The definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to
+     generate the appropriate rtl instructions.  It is used only when
+     compiling the end of `main'.
+
+`HAVE_ATEXIT'
+     Define this if the target system supports the function `atexit'
+     from the ANSI C standard.  If this is not defined, and
+     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' is not defined, a default `exit' function
+     will be provided to support C++.
+
+`EXIT_BODY'
+     Define this if your `exit' function needs to do something besides
+     calling an external function `_cleanup' before terminating with
+     `_exit'.  The `EXIT_BODY' macro is only needed if neither
+     `HAVE_ATEXIT' nor `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' are defined.
+
+`INSN_SETS_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)'
+     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
+     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
+     slot of INSN, even if they appear to use a resource set or
+     clobbered in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'; GNU
+     CC knows that every `call_insn' has this behavior.  On machines
+     where some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function call and
+     hence has this behavior, you should define this macro.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.
+
+`INSN_REFERENCES_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)'
+     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
+     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
+     slot of INSN, even if they appear to set or clobber a resource
+     referenced in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'.
+     On machines where some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function
+     call and its operands are registers whose use is actually in the
+     subroutine it calls, you should define this macro.  Doing so
+     allows the delay slot scheduler to move instructions which copy
+     arguments into the argument registers into the delay slot of INSN.
+
+     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.
+
+`MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG (INSN)'
+     In rare cases, correct code generation requires extra machine
+     dependent processing between the second jump optimization pass and
+     delayed branch scheduling.  On those machines, define this macro
+     as a C statement to act on the code starting at INSN.
+
+`MULTIPLE_SYMBOL_SPACES'
+     Define this macro if in some cases global symbols from one
+     translation unit may not be bound to undefined symbols in another
+     translation unit without user intervention.  For instance, under
+     Microsoft Windows symbols must be explicitly imported from shared
+     libraries (DLLs).
+
+`ISSUE_RATE'
+     A C expression that returns how many instructions can be issued at
+     the same time if the machine is a superscalar machine.  This is
+     only used by the `Haifa' scheduler, and not the traditional
+     scheduler.
+
+`MD_SCHED_INIT (FILE, VERBOSE)'
+     A C statement which is executed by the `Haifa' scheduler at the
+     beginning of each block of instructions that are to be scheduled.
+     FILE is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any
+     debug output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level provided by
+     `-fsched-verbose-'N.
+
+`MD_SCHED_REORDER (FILE, VERBOSE, READY, N_READY)'
+     A C statement which is executed by the `Haifa' scheduler after it
+     has scheduled the ready list to allow the machine description to
+     reorder it (for example to combine two small instructions together
+     on `VLIW' machines).  FILE is either a null pointer, or a stdio
+     stream to write any debug output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level
+     provided by `-fsched-verbose-'N.  READY is a pointer to the ready
+     list of instructions that are ready to be scheduled.  N_READY is
+     the number of elements in the ready list.  The scheduler reads the
+     ready list in reverse order, starting with READY[N_READY-1] and
+     going to READY[0].
+
+`MD_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE (FILE, VERBOSE, INSN, MORE)'
+     A C statement which is executed by the `Haifa' scheduler after it
+     has scheduled an insn from the ready list.  FILE is either a null
+     pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug output to.  VERBOSE
+     is the verbose level provided by `-fsched-verbose-'N.  INSN is the
+     instruction that was scheduled.  MORE is the number of
+     instructions that can be issued in the current cycle.  The
+     `MD_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE' macro is responsible for updating the
+     value of MORE (typically by MORE-).
+
+`MAX_INTEGER_COMPUTATION_MODE'
+     Define this to the largest integer machine mode which can be used
+     for operations other than load, store and copy operations.
+
+     You need only define this macro if the target holds values larger
+     than `word_mode' in general purpose registers.  Most targets
+     should not define this macro.
+
+`MATH_LIBRARY'
+     Define this macro as a C string constant for the linker argument
+     to link in the system math library, or `""' if the target does not
+     have a separate math library.
+
+     You need only define this macro if the default of `"-lm"' is wrong.

+
+The Configuration File
+**********************
+
+   The configuration file `xm-MACHINE.h' contains macro definitions
+that describe the machine and system on which the compiler is running,
+unlike the definitions in `MACHINE.h', which describe the machine for
+which the compiler is producing output.  Most of the values in
+`xm-MACHINE.h' are actually the same on all machines that GCC runs on,
+so large parts of all configuration files are identical.  But there are
+some macros that vary:
+
+`USG'
+     Define this macro if the host system is System V.
+
+`VMS'
+     Define this macro if the host system is VMS.
+
+`FATAL_EXIT_CODE'
+     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
+     exits after serious errors.
+
+`SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE'
+     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
+     exits without serious errors.
+
+`HOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
+     Defined if the host machine stores words of multi-word values in
+     big-endian order.  (GCC does not depend on the host byte ordering
+     within a word.)
+
+`HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
+     Define this macro to be 1 if the host machine stores `DFmode',
+     `XFmode' or `TFmode' floating point numbers in memory with the
+     word containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise,
+     define it to be zero.
+
+     This macro need not be defined if the ordering is the same as for
+     multi-word integers.
+
+`HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT'
+     A numeric code distinguishing the floating point format for the
+     host machine.  See `TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT' in *Note Storage Layout::
+     for the alternatives and default.
+
+`HOST_BITS_PER_CHAR'
+     A C expression for the number of bits in `char' on the host
+     machine.
+
+`HOST_BITS_PER_SHORT'
+     A C expression for the number of bits in `short' on the host
+     machine.
+
+`HOST_BITS_PER_INT'
+     A C expression for the number of bits in `int' on the host machine.
+
+`HOST_BITS_PER_LONG'
+     A C expression for the number of bits in `long' on the host
+     machine.
+
+`ONLY_INT_FIELDS'
+     Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler only supports
+     `int' bit fields, rather than other integral types, including
+     `enum', as do most C compilers.
+
+`OBSTACK_CHUNK_SIZE'
+     A C expression for the size of ordinary obstack chunks.  If you
+     don't define this, a usually-reasonable default is used.
+
+`OBSTACK_CHUNK_ALLOC'
+     The function used to allocate obstack chunks.  If you don't define
+     this, `xmalloc' is used.
+
+`OBSTACK_CHUNK_FREE'
+     The function used to free obstack chunks.  If you don't define
+     this, `free' is used.
+
+`USE_C_ALLOCA'
+     Define this macro to indicate that the compiler is running with the
+     `alloca' implemented in C.  This version of `alloca' can be found
+     in the file `alloca.c'; to use it, you must also alter the
+     `Makefile' variable `ALLOCA'.  (This is done automatically for the
+     systems on which we know it is needed.)
+
+     If you do define this macro, you should probably do it as follows:
+
+          #ifndef __GNUC__
+          #define USE_C_ALLOCA
+          #else
+          #define alloca __builtin_alloca
+          #endif
+
+     so that when the compiler is compiled with GCC it uses the more
+     efficient built-in `alloca' function.
+
+`FUNCTION_CONVERSION_BUG'
+     Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler does not
+     properly handle converting a function value to a
+     pointer-to-function when it is used in an expression.
+
+`MULTIBYTE_CHARS'
+     Define this macro to enable support for multibyte characters in the
+     input to GCC.  This requires that the host system support the ANSI
+     C library functions for converting multibyte characters to wide
+     characters.
+
+`POSIX'
+     Define this if your system is POSIX.1 compliant.
+
+`NO_SYS_SIGLIST'
+     Define this if your system *does not* provide the variable
+     `sys_siglist'.
+
+     Some systems do provide this variable, but with a different name
+     such as `_sys_siglist'.  On these systems, you can define
+     `sys_siglist' as a macro which expands into the name actually
+     provided.
+
+     Autoconf normally defines `SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED' when it finds a
+     declaration of `sys_siglist' in the system header files.  However,
+     when you define `sys_siglist' to a different name autoconf will
+     not automatically define `SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED'.  Therefore, if
+     you define `sys_siglist', you should also define
+     `SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED'.
+
+`USE_PROTOTYPES'
+     Define this to be 1 if you know that the host compiler supports
+     prototypes, even if it doesn't define __STDC__, or define it to be
+     0 if you do not want any prototypes used in compiling GCC.  If
+     `USE_PROTOTYPES' is not defined, it will be determined
+     automatically whether your compiler supports prototypes by
+     checking if `__STDC__' is defined.
+
+`NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
+     Define this if you wish suppression of prototypes generated from
+     the machine description file, but to use other prototypes within
+     GCC.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the host compiler
+     does not support prototypes, this macro has no effect.
+
+`MD_CALL_PROTOTYPES'
+     Define this if you wish to generate prototypes for the `gen_call'
+     or `gen_call_value' functions generated from the machine
+     description file.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the
+     host compiler does not support prototypes, or `NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
+     is defined, this macro has no effect.  As soon as all of the
+     machine descriptions are modified to have the appropriate number
+     of arguments, this macro will be removed.
+
+`PATH_SEPARATOR'
+     Define this macro to be a C character constant representing the
+     character used to separate components in paths.  The default value
+     is the colon character
+
+`DIR_SEPARATOR'
+     If your system uses some character other than slash to separate
+     directory names within a file specification, define this macro to
+     be a C character constant specifying that character.  When GCC
+     displays file names, the character you specify will be used.  GCC
+     will test for both slash and the character you specify when
+     parsing filenames.
+
+`OBJECT_SUFFIX'
+     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
+     object files on your machine.  If you do not define this macro,
+     GCC will use `.o' as the suffix for object files.
+
+`EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX'
+     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
+     executable files on your machine.  If you do not define this
+     macro, GCC will use the null string as the suffix for object files.
+
+`COLLECT_EXPORT_LIST'
+     If defined, `collect2' will scan the individual object files
+     specified on its command line and create an export list for the
+     linker.  Define this macro for systems like AIX, where the linker
+     discards object files that are not referenced from `main' and uses
+     export lists.
+
+   In addition, configuration files for system V define `bcopy',
+`bzero' and `bcmp' as aliases.  Some files define `alloca' as a macro
+when compiled with GCC, in order to take advantage of the benefit of
+GCC's built-in `alloca'.

+Makefile Fragments
+******************
+
+   When you configure GCC using the `configure' script (*note
+Installation::.), it will construct the file `Makefile' from the
+template file `Makefile.in'.  When it does this, it will incorporate
+makefile fragment files from the `config' directory, named `t-TARGET'
+and `x-HOST'.  If these files do not exist, it means nothing needs to
+be added for a given target or host.
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Target Fragment:: Writing the `t-TARGET' file.
+* Host Fragment::   Writing the `x-HOST' file.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Target Fragment,  Next: Host Fragment,  Up: Fragments
+
+The Target Makefile Fragment
+============================
+
+   The target makefile fragment, `t-TARGET', defines special target
+dependent variables and targets used in the `Makefile':
+
+`LIBGCC1'
+     The rule to use to build `libgcc1.a'.  If your target does not
+     need to use the functions in `libgcc1.a', set this to empty.
+     *Note Interface::.
+
+`CROSS_LIBGCC1'
+     The rule to use to build `libgcc1.a' when building a cross
+     compiler.  If your target does not need to use the functions in
+     `libgcc1.a', set this to empty.  *Note Cross Runtime::.
+
+`LIBGCC2_CFLAGS'
+     Compiler flags to use when compiling `libgcc2.c'.
+
+`LIB2FUNCS_EXTRA'
+     A list of source file names to be compiled or assembled and
+     inserted into `libgcc.a'.
+
+`CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS'
+     Special flags used when compiling `crtstuff.c'.  *Note
+     Initialization::.
+
+`CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS_S'
+     Special flags used when compiling `crtstuff.c' for shared linking.
+     Used if you use `crtbeginS.o' and `crtendS.o' in `EXTRA-PARTS'.
+     *Note Initialization::.
+
+`MULTILIB_OPTIONS'
+     For some targets, invoking GCC in different ways produces objects
+     that can not be linked together.  For example, for some targets GCC
+     produces both big and little endian code.  For these targets, you
+     must arrange for multiple versions of `libgcc.a' to be compiled,
+     one for each set of incompatible options.  When GCC invokes the
+     linker, it arranges to link in the right version of `libgcc.a',
+     based on the command line options used.
+
+     The `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' macro lists the set of options for which
+     special versions of `libgcc.a' must be built.  Write options that
+     are mutually incompatible side by side, separated by a slash.
+     Write options that may be used together separated by a space.  The
+     build procedure will build all combinations of compatible options.
+
+     For example, if you set `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' to `m68000/m68020
+     msoft-float', `Makefile' will build special versions of `libgcc.a'
+     using the following sets of options:  `-m68000', `-m68020',
+     `-msoft-float', `-m68000 -msoft-float', and `-m68020 -msoft-float'.
+
+`MULTILIB_DIRNAMES'
+     If `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is used, this variable specifies the
+     directory names that should be used to hold the various libraries.
+     Write one element in `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' for each element in
+     `MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.  If `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is not used, the
+     default value will be `MULTILIB_OPTIONS', with all slashes treated
+     as spaces.
+
+     For example, if `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is set to `m68000/m68020
+     msoft-float', then the default value of `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is
+     `m68000 m68020 msoft-float'.  You may specify a different value if
+     you desire a different set of directory names.
+
+`MULTILIB_MATCHES'
+     Sometimes the same option may be written in two different ways.
+     If an option is listed in `MULTILIB_OPTIONS', GCC needs to know
+     about any synonyms.  In that case, set `MULTILIB_MATCHES' to a
+     list of items of the form `option=option' to describe all relevant
+     synonyms.  For example, `m68000=mc68000 m68020=mc68020'.
+
+`MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS'
+     Sometimes when there are multiple sets of `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' being
+     specified, there are combinations that should not be built.  In
+     that case, set `MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' to be all of the switch
+     exceptions in shell case syntax that should not be built.
+
+     For example, in the PowerPC embedded ABI support, it was not
+     desirable to build libraries that compiled with the
+     `-mcall-aixdesc' option and either of the `-mcall-aixdesc' or
+     `-mlittle' options at the same time, and therefore
+     `MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' is set to `*mrelocatable/*mcall-aixdesc*
+     *mlittle/*mcall-aixdesc*'.
+
+`MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS'
+     Sometimes it is desirable that when building multiple versions of
+     `libgcc.a' certain options should always be passed on to the
+     compiler.  In that case, set `MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS' to be the list
+     of options to be used for all builds.

+Funding Free Software
+*********************
+
+   If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
+sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
+development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
+commercial redistributors to donate.
+
+   Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
+encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
+to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.
+
+   The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and
+expect it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them
+partly by how much they give to free software development.  Show
+distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.
+
+   To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
+compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
+for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
+"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
+for comparison.
+
+   Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
+meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
+can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.
+If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably less
+than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.
+
+   Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful
+too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do,
+and what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
+difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
+a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
+program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
+contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
+ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection
+contribute more; major new features or packages contribute the most.
+
+   By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
+proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
+assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

+   Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every
+day, without realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the
+version of GNU which is widely used today is more often known as
+"Linux", and many users are not aware of the extent of its connection
+with the GNU Project.
+
+   There really is a Linux; it is a kernel, and these people are using
+it.  But you can't use a kernel by itself; a kernel is useful only as
+part of a whole system.  The system in which Linux is typically used is
+a modified variant of the GNU system--in other words, a Linux-based GNU
+system.
+
+   Many users are not fully aware of the distinction between the kernel,
+which is Linux, and the whole system, which they also call "Linux".
+The ambiguous use of the name doesn't promote understanding.
+
+   Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel.  But since they
+have generally heard the whole system called "Linux" as well, they
+often envisage a history which fits that name.  For example, many
+believe that once Linus Torvalds finished writing the kernel, his
+friends looked around for other free software, and for no particular
+reason most everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was already
+available.
+
+   What they found was no accident--it was the GNU system.  The
+available free software added up to a complete system because the GNU
+Project had been working since 1984 to make one.  The GNU Manifesto had
+set forth the goal of developing a free Unix-like system, called GNU.
+By the time Linux was written, the system was almost finished.
+
+   Most free software projects have the goal of developing a particular
+program for a particular job.  For example, Linus Torvalds set out to
+write a Unix-like kernel (Linux); Donald Knuth set out to write a text
+formatter (TeX); Bob Scheifler set out to develop a window system (X
+Windows).  It's natural to measure the contribution of this kind of
+project by specific programs that came from the project.
+
+   If we tried to measure the GNU Project's contribution in this way,
+what would we conclude?  One CD-ROM vendor found that in their "Linux
+distribution", GNU software was the largest single contingent, around
+28% of the total source code, and this included some of the essential
+major components without which there could be no system.  Linux itself
+was about 3%.  So if you were going to pick a name for the system based
+on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single
+choice would be "GNU".
+
+   But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question.
+The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific software
+packages.  It was not a project to develop a C compiler, although we
+did.  It was not a project to develop a text editor, although we
+developed one.  The GNU Project's aim was to develop *a complete free
+Unix-like system*.
+
+   Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the
+system, and they all deserve credit.  But the reason it is *a
+system*--and not just a collection of useful programs--is because the
+GNU Project set out to make it one.  We wrote the programs that were
+needed to make a *complete* free system.  We wrote essential but
+unexciting major components, such as the assembler and linker, because
+you can't have a system without them.  A complete system needs more
+than just programming tools, so we wrote other components as well, such
+as the Bourne Again SHell, the PostScript interpreter Ghostscript, and
+the GNU C library.
+
+   By the early 90s we had put together the whole system aside from the
+kernel (and we were also working on a kernel, the GNU Hurd, which runs
+on top of Mach).  Developing this kernel has been a lot harder than we
+expected, and we are still working on finishing it.
+
+   Fortunately, you don't have to wait for it, because Linux is working
+now.  When Linus Torvalds wrote Linux, he filled the last major gap.
+People could then put Linux together with the GNU system to make a
+complete free system: a Linux-based GNU system (or GNU/Linux system,
+for short).
+
+   Putting them together sounds simple, but it was not a trivial job.
+The GNU C library (called glibc for short) needed substantial changes.
+Integrating a complete system as a distribution that would work "out of
+the box" was a big job, too.  It required addressing the issue of how
+to install and boot the system--a problem we had not tackled, because
+we hadn't yet reached that point.  The people who developed the various
+system distributions made a substantial contribution.
+
+   The GNU Project supports GNU/Linux systems as well as *the* GNU
+system--even with funds.  We funded the rewriting of the Linux-related
+extensions to the GNU C library, so that now they are well integrated,
+and the newest GNU/Linux systems use the current library release with
+no changes.  We also funded an early stage of the development of Debian
+GNU/Linux.
+
+   We use Linux-based GNU systems today for most of our work, and we
+hope you use them too.  But please don't confuse the public by using the
+name "Linux" ambiguously.  Linux is the kernel, one of the essential
+major components of the system.  The system as a whole is more or less
+the GNU system.

+GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+**************************
+

+
+     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

+     
+     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+Preamble
+========
+
+   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
+new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
+and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
+     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
+     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
+     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
+     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
+     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
+     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
+     licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
+     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
+     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
+     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
+     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
+     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
+     this License along with the Program.
+
+     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
+     for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
+          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
+          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
+          to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
+          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
+          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
+          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
+          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
+          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
+          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
+          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
+          to print an announcement.)
+
+     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
+     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
+     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
+     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
+     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
+     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
+     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
+     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
+     and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
+     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
+     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
+     derivative or collective works based on the Program.
+
+     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
+     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
+     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
+     other work under the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
+     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
+     following:
+
+       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
+          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
+          software interchange; or,
+
+       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+          received the program in object code or executable form with
+          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
+     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
+     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
+     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
+     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
+     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
+     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
+     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
+     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
+
+     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
+     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
+     from you under this License will not have their licenses
+     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
+     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
+     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
+     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
+     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
+     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
+     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
+     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
+     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
+     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
+     by third parties to this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
+     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
+     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
+     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
+     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
+     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
+     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
+     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
+     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
+     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
+     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
+     entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
+     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
+     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
+     in other circumstances.
+
+     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
+     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
+     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
+     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
+     licensee cannot impose that choice.
+
+     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
+     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
+     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
+     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
+     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
+     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
+     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
+     this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
+     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
+     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
+     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
+     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
+     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
+     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
+     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
+     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
+
+ 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
+     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
+     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
+     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
+     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
+     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+     and reuse of software generally.
+
+                                NO WARRANTY
+
+ 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
+     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
+     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
+     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
+     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
+     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
+     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
+     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+ 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
+     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
+     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
+     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
+     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
+     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
+     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
+     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
+     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+=============================================
+
+   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
+terms.
+
+   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
+     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR
+     
+     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+     (at your option) any later version.
+     
+     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+     GNU General Public License for more details.
+     
+     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
+     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
+
+   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
+mail.
+
+   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
+this when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YYYY NAME OF AUTHOR
+     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
+     type `show w'.
+     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
+appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
+commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
+c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
+program.
+
+   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
+your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
+if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+     
+     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
+     Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
+program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
+library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
+applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
+GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

+
+Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC
+=========================================
+
+   GCC has various special options that are used for debugging either
+your program or GCC:
+
+`-g'
+     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native
+     format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this
+     debugging information.
+
+     On most systems that use stabs format, `-g' enables use of extra
+     debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
+     makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other
+     debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to
+     control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use
+     `-gstabs+', `-gstabs', `-gxcoff+', `-gxcoff', `-gdwarf-1+', or
+     `-gdwarf-1' (see below).
+
+     Unlike most other C compilers, GCC allows you to use `-g' with
+     `-O'.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
+     produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not
+     exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not
+     expect it; some statements may not be executed because they
+     compute constant results or their values were already at hand;
+     some statements may execute in different places because they were
+     moved out of loops.
+
+     Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This
+     makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might
+     have bugs.
+
+     The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
+     capability for more than one debugging format.
+
+`-ggdb'
+     Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use
+     the most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the
+     native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB
+     extensions if at all possible.
+
+`-gstabs'
+     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
+     supported), without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by
+     DBX on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4
+     systems this option produces stabs debugging output which is not
+     understood by DBX or SDB.  On System V Release 4 systems this
+     option requires the GNU assembler.
+
+`-gstabs+'
+     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
+     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
+     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
+     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.
+
+`-gcoff'
+     Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is
+     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
+     systems prior to System V Release 4.
+
+`-gxcoff'
+     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
+     supported).  This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM
+     RS/6000 systems.
+
+`-gxcoff+'
+     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
+     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
+     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
+     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program, and may cause
+     assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS) to fail with an
+     error.
+
+`-gdwarf'
+     Produce debugging information in DWARF version 1 format (if that is
+     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
+     Release 4 systems.
+
+`-gdwarf+'
+     Produce debugging information in DWARF version 1 format (if that is
+     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
+     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
+     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.
+
+`-gdwarf-2'
+     Produce debugging information in DWARF version 2 format (if that is
+     supported).  This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6.
+
+`-gLEVEL'
+`-ggdbLEVEL'
+`-gstabsLEVEL'
+`-gcoffLEVEL'
+`-gxcoffLEVEL'
+`-gdwarfLEVEL'
+`-gdwarf-2LEVEL'
+     Request debugging information and also use LEVEL to specify how
+     much information.  The default level is 2.
+
+     Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces
+     in parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This
+     includes descriptions of functions and external variables, but no
+     information about local variables and no line numbers.
+
+     Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro
+     definitions present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro
+     expansion when you use `-g3'.
+
+`-p'
+     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
+     analysis program `prof'.  You must use this option when compiling
+     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
+     linking.
+
+`-pg'
+     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
+     analysis program `gprof'.  You must use this option when compiling
+     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
+     linking.
+
+`-a'
+     Generate extra code to write profile information for basic blocks,
+     which will record the number of times each basic block is
+     executed, the basic block start address, and the function name
+     containing the basic block.  If `-g' is used, the line number and
+     filename of the start of the basic block will also be recorded.
+     If not overridden by the machine description, the default action is
+     to append to the text file `bb.out'.
+
+     This data could be analyzed by a program like `tcov'.  Note,
+     however, that the format of the data is not what `tcov' expects.
+     Eventually GNU `gprof' should be extended to process this data.
+
+`-Q'
+     Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled,
+     and print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
+
+`-ax'
+     Generate extra code to profile basic blocks.  Your executable will
+     produce output that is a superset of that produced when `-a' is
+     used.  Additional output is the source and target address of the
+     basic blocks where a jump takes place, the number of times a jump
+     is executed, and (optionally) the complete sequence of basic
+     blocks being executed.  The output is appended to file `bb.out'.
+
+     You can examine different profiling aspects without recompilation.
+     Your executable will read a list of function names from file
+     `bb.in'.  Profiling starts when a function on the list is entered
+     and stops when that invocation is exited.  To exclude a function
+     from profiling, prefix its name with `-'.  If a function name is
+     not unique, you can disambiguate it by writing it in the form
+     `/path/filename.d:functionname'.  Your executable will write the
+     available paths and filenames in file `bb.out'.
+
+     Several function names have a special meaning:
+    `__bb_jumps__'
+          Write source, target and frequency of jumps to file `bb.out'.
+
+    `__bb_hidecall__'
+          Exclude function calls from frequency count.
+
+    `__bb_showret__'
+          Include function returns in frequency count.
+
+    `__bb_trace__'
+          Write the sequence of basic blocks executed to file
+          `bbtrace.gz'.  The file will be compressed using the program
+          `gzip', which must exist in your `PATH'.  On systems without
+          the `popen' function, the file will be named `bbtrace' and
+          will not be compressed.  *Profiling for even a few seconds on
+          these systems will produce a very large file.*  Note:
+          `__bb_hidecall__' and `__bb_showret__' will not affect the
+          sequence written to `bbtrace.gz'.
+
+     Here's a short example using different profiling parameters in
+     file `bb.in'.  Assume function `foo' consists of basic blocks 1
+     and 2 and is called twice from block 3 of function `main'.  After
+     the calls, block 3 transfers control to block 4 of `main'.
+
+     With `__bb_trace__' and `main' contained in file `bb.in', the
+     following sequence of blocks is written to file `bbtrace.gz': 0 3
+     1 2 1 2 4.  The return from block 2 to block 3 is not shown,
+     because the return is to a point inside the block and not to the
+     top.  The block address 0 always indicates, that control is
+     transferred to the trace from somewhere outside the observed
+     functions.  With `-foo' added to `bb.in', the blocks of function
+     `foo' are removed from the trace, so only 0 3 4 remains.
+
+     With `__bb_jumps__' and `main' contained in file `bb.in', jump
+     frequencies will be written to file `bb.out'.  The frequencies are
+     obtained by constructing a trace of blocks and incrementing a
+     counter for every neighbouring pair of blocks in the trace.  The
+     trace 0 3 1 2 1 2 4 displays the following frequencies:
+
+          Jump from block 0x0 to block 0x3 executed 1 time(s)
+          Jump from block 0x3 to block 0x1 executed 1 time(s)
+          Jump from block 0x1 to block 0x2 executed 2 time(s)
+          Jump from block 0x2 to block 0x1 executed 1 time(s)
+          Jump from block 0x2 to block 0x4 executed 1 time(s)
+
+     With `__bb_hidecall__', control transfer due to call instructions
+     is removed from the trace, that is the trace is cut into three
+     parts: 0 3 4, 0 1 2 and 0 1 2.  With `__bb_showret__', control
+     transfer due to return instructions is added to the trace.  The
+     trace becomes: 0 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4.  Note, that this trace is not
+     the same, as the sequence written to `bbtrace.gz'.  It is solely
+     used for counting jump frequencies.
+
+`-fprofile-arcs'
+     Instrument "arcs" during compilation.  For each function of your
+     program, GCC creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning
+     tree for the graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree
+     have to be instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the
+     number of times that these arcs are executed.  When an arc is the
+     only exit or only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code
+     can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic block must be
+     created to hold the instrumentation code.
+
+     Since not every arc in the program must be instrumented, programs
+     compiled with this option run faster than programs compiled with
+     `-a', which adds instrumentation code to every basic block in the
+     program.  The tradeoff: since `gcov' does not have execution
+     counts for all branches, it must start with the execution counts
+     for the instrumented branches, and then iterate over the program
+     flow graph until the entire graph has been solved.  Hence, `gcov'
+     runs a little more slowly than a program which uses information
+     from `-a'.
+
+     `-fprofile-arcs' also makes it possible to estimate branch
+     probabilities, and to calculate basic block execution counts.  In
+     general, basic block execution counts do not give enough
+     information to estimate all branch probabilities.  When the
+     compiled program exits, it saves the arc execution counts to a
+     file called `SOURCENAME.da'.  Use the compiler option
+     `-fbranch-probabilities' (*note Options that Control Optimization:
+     Optimize Options.) when recompiling, to optimize using estimated
+     branch probabilities.
+
+`-ftest-coverage'
+     Create data files for the `gcov' code-coverage utility (*note
+     `gcov': a GCC Test Coverage Program: Gcov.).  The data file names
+     begin with the name of your source file:
+
+    `SOURCENAME.bb'
+          A mapping from basic blocks to line numbers, which `gcov'
+          uses to associate basic block execution counts with line
+          numbers.
+
+    `SOURCENAME.bbg'
+          A list of all arcs in the program flow graph.  This allows
+          `gcov' to reconstruct the program flow graph, so that it can
+          compute all basic block and arc execution counts from the
+          information in the `SOURCENAME.da' file (this last file is
+          the output from `-fprofile-arcs').
+
+`-Q'
+     Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled,
+     and print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
+
+`-dLETTERS'
+     Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified
+     by LETTERS.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file
+     names for most of the dumps are made by appending a word to the
+     source file name (e.g.  `foo.c.rtl' or `foo.c.jump').  Here are the
+     possible letters for use in LETTERS, and their meanings:
+
+    `b'
+          Dump after computing branch probabilities, to `FILE.bp'.
+
+    `c'
+          Dump after instruction combination, to the file
+          `FILE.combine'.
+
+    `d'
+          Dump after delayed branch scheduling, to `FILE.dbr'.
+
+    `D'
+          Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, in
+          addition to normal output.
+
+    `r'
+          Dump after RTL generation, to `FILE.rtl'.
+
+    `j'
+          Dump after first jump optimization, to `FILE.jump'.
+
+    `F'
+          Dump after purging ADDRESSOF, to `FILE.addressof'.
+
+    `f'
+          Dump after flow analysis, to `FILE.flow'.
+
+    `g'
+          Dump after global register allocation, to `FILE.greg'.
+
+    `G'
+          Dump after GCSE, to `FILE.gcse'.
+
+    `j'
+          Dump after first jump optimization, to `FILE.jump'.
+
+    `J'
+          Dump after last jump optimization, to `FILE.jump2'.
+
+    `k'
+          Dump after conversion from registers to stack, to
+          `FILE.stack'.
+
+    `l'
+          Dump after local register allocation, to `FILE.lreg'.
+
+    `L'
+          Dump after loop optimization, to `FILE.loop'.
+
+    `M'
+          Dump after performing the machine dependent reorganisation
+          pass, to `FILE.mach'.
+
+    `N'
+          Dump after the register move pass, to `FILE.regmove'.
+
+    `r'
+          Dump after RTL generation, to `FILE.rtl'.
+
+    `R'
+          Dump after the second instruction scheduling pass, to
+          `FILE.sched2'.
+
+    `s'
+          Dump after CSE (including the jump optimization that
+          sometimes follows CSE), to `FILE.cse'.
+
+    `S'
+          Dump after the first instruction scheduling pass, to
+          `FILE.sched'.
+
+    `t'
+          Dump after the second CSE pass (including the jump
+          optimization that sometimes follows CSE), to `FILE.cse2'.
+
+    `a'
+          Produce all the dumps listed above.
+
+    `m'
+          Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the run, to
+          standard error.
+
+    `p'
+          Annotate the assembler output with a comment indicating which
+          pattern and alternative was used.  The length of each
+          instruction is also printed.
+
+    `x'
+          Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.
+          Usually used with `r'.
+
+    `y'
+          Dump debugging information during parsing, to standard error.
+
+    `A'
+          Annotate the assembler output with miscellaneous debugging
+          information.
+
+`-fdump-unnumbered'
+     When doing debugging dumps (see -d option above), suppress
+     instruction numbers and line number note output.  This makes it
+     more feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for compiler
+     invokations with different options, in particular with and without
+     -g.
+
+`-fpretend-float'
+     When running a cross-compiler, pretend that the target machine
+     uses the same floating point format as the host machine.  This
+     causes incorrect output of the actual floating constants, but the
+     actual instruction sequence will probably be the same as GCC would
+     make when running on the target machine.
+
+`-save-temps'
+     Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place
+     them in the current directory and name them based on the source
+     file.  Thus, compiling `foo.c' with `-c -save-temps' would produce
+     files `foo.i' and `foo.s', as well as `foo.o'.
+
+`-print-file-name=LIBRARY'
+     Print the full absolute name of the library file LIBRARY that
+     would be used when linking--and don't do anything else.  With this
+     option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
+     file name.
+
+`-print-prog-name=PROGRAM'
+     Like `-print-file-name', but searches for a program such as `cpp'.
+
+`-print-libgcc-file-name'
+     Same as `-print-file-name=libgcc.a'.
+
+     This is useful when you use `-nostdlib' or `-nodefaultlibs' but
+     you do want to link with `libgcc.a'.  You can do
+
+          gcc -nostdlib FILES... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
+
+`-print-search-dirs'
+     Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list
+     of program and library directories gcc will search--and don't do
+     anything else.
+
+     This is useful when gcc prints the error message `installation
+     problem, cannot exec cpp: No such file or directory'.  To resolve
+     this you either need to put `cpp' and the other compiler
+     components where gcc expects to find them, or you can set the
+     environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' to the directory where you
+     installed them.  Don't forget the trailing '/'.  *Note Environment
+     Variables::.

+
+Options That Control Optimization
+=================================
+
+   These options control various sorts of optimizations:
+
+`-O'
+`-O1'
+     Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a
+     lot more memory for a large function.
+
+     Without `-O', the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
+     compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
+     Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
+     breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to
+     any variable or change the program counter to any other statement
+     in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from
+     the source code.
+
+     Without `-O', the compiler only allocates variables declared
+     `register' in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little
+     worse than produced by PCC without `-O'.
+
+     With `-O', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
+     time.
+
+     When you specify `-O', the compiler turns on `-fthread-jumps' and
+     `-fdefer-pop' on all machines.  The compiler turns on
+     `-fdelayed-branch' on machines that have delay slots, and
+     `-fomit-frame-pointer' on machines that can support debugging even
+     without a frame pointer.  On some machines the compiler also turns
+     on other flags.
+
+`-O2'
+     Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported
+     optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The
+     compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining when
+     you specify `-O2'.  As compared to `-O', this option increases
+     both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.
+
+     `-O2' turns on all optional optimizations except for loop
+     unrolling, function inlining, and strict aliasing optimizations.
+     It also turns on the `-fforce-mem' option on all machines and
+     frame pointer elimination on machines where doing so does not
+     interfere with debugging.
+
+`-O3'
+     Optimize yet more.  `-O3' turns on all optimizations specified by
+     `-O2' and also turns on the `inline-functions' option.
+
+`-O0'
+     Do not optimize.
+
+`-Os'
+     Optimize for size.  `-Os' enables all `-O2' optimizations that do
+     not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
+     optimizations designed to reduce code size.
+
+     If you use multiple `-O' options, with or without level numbers,
+     the last such option is the one that is effective.
+
+   Options of the form `-fFLAG' specify machine-independent flags.
+Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
+`-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the forms
+is listed--the one which is not the default.  You can figure out the
+other form by either removing `no-' or adding it.
+
+`-ffloat-store'
+     Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit
+     other options that might change whether a floating point value is
+     taken from a register or memory.
+
+     This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such
+     as the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
+     precision than a `double' is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
+     x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does
+     only good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of
+     IEEE floating point.  Use `-ffloat-store' for such programs, after
+     modifying them to store all pertinent intermediate computations
+     into variables.
+
+`-fno-default-inline'
+     Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they
+     are defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when
+     you specify `-O', member functions defined inside class scope are
+     compiled inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add `inline'
+     in front of the member function name.
+
+`-fno-defer-pop'
+     Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that
+     function returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a
+     function call, the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on
+     the stack for several function calls and pops them all at once.
+
+`-fforce-mem'
+     Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
+     arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
+     references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not
+     common subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate
+     the separate register-load.  The `-O2' option turns on this option.
+
+`-fforce-addr'
+     Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
+     doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
+     `-fforce-mem' may.
+
+`-fomit-frame-pointer'
+     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
+     don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
+     restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
+     in many functions.  *It also makes debugging impossible on some
+     machines.*
+
+     On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no effect, because
+     the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame
+     pointer and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
+     machine-description macro `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' controls
+     whether a target machine supports this flag.  *Note Registers::.
+
+`-fno-inline'
+     Don't pay attention to the `inline' keyword.  Normally this option
+     is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
+     Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded
+     inline.
+
+`-finline-functions'
+     Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
+     heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
+     integrating in this way.
+
+     If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
+     is declared `static', then the function is normally not output as
+     assembler code in its own right.
+
+`-finline-limit-N'
+     By default, gcc limits the size of functions that can be inlined.
+     This flag allows the control of this limit for functions that are
+     explicitly marked as inline (ie marked with the inline keyword or
+     defined within the class definition in c++).  N is the size of
+     functions that can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions
+     (not counting parameter handling).  The default value of n is
+     10000.  Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
+     the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing
+     usually makes the compilation faster and less code will be inlined
+     (which presumably means slower programs).  This option is
+     particularly useful for programs that use inlining heavily such as
+     those based on recursive templates with c++.
+
+     *Note:* pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context,
+     an abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way, it
+     represents a count of assembly instructions and as such its exact
+     meaning might change from one release to an another.
+
+`-fkeep-inline-functions'
+     Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the
+     function is declared `static', nevertheless output a separate
+     run-time callable version of the function.  This switch does not
+     affect `extern inline' functions.
+
+`-fkeep-static-consts'
+     Emit variables declared `static const' when optimization isn't
+     turned on, even if the variables aren't referenced.
+
+     GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the
+     compiler to check if the variable was referenced, regardless of
+     whether or not optimization is turned on, use the
+     `-fno-keep-static-consts' option.
+
+`-fno-function-cse'
+     Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction
+     that calls a constant function contain the function's address
+     explicitly.
+
+     This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
+     that alter the assembler output may be confused by the
+     optimizations performed when this option is not used.
+
+`-ffast-math'
+     This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules and/or
+     specifications in the interest of optimizing code for speed.  For
+     example, it allows the compiler to assume arguments to the `sqrt'
+     function are non-negative numbers and that no floating-point values
+     are NaNs.
+
+     This option should never be turned on by any `-O' option since it
+     can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an
+     exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for math
+     functions.
+
+   The following options control specific optimizations.  The `-O2'
+option turns on all of these optimizations except `-funroll-loops'
+`-funroll-all-loops', and `-fstrict-aliasing'.  On most machines, the
+`-O' option turns on the `-fthread-jumps' and `-fdelayed-branch'
+options, but specific machines may handle it differently.
+
+   You can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning"
+of optimizations to be performed is desired.
+
+`-fstrength-reduce'
+     Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
+     elimination of iteration variables.
+
+`-fthread-jumps'
+     Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
+     location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.
+     If so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of
+     the second branch or a point immediately following it, depending
+     on whether the condition is known to be true or false.
+
+`-fcse-follow-jumps'
+     In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
+     when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
+     example, when CSE encounters an `if' statement with an `else'
+     clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition tested is
+     false.
+
+`-fcse-skip-blocks'
+     This is similar to `-fcse-follow-jumps', but causes CSE to follow
+     jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE encounters a
+     simple `if' statement with no else clause, `-fcse-skip-blocks'
+     causes CSE to follow the jump around the body of the `if'.
+
+`-frerun-cse-after-loop'
+     Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations
+     has been performed.
+
+`-frerun-loop-opt'
+     Run the loop optimizer twice.
+
+`-fgcse'
+     Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.  This pass
+     also performs global constant and copy propagation.
+
+`-fexpensive-optimizations'
+     Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
+     expensive.
+
+`-foptimize-register-moves'
+`-fregmove'
+     Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as
+     operands of other simple instructions in order to maximize the
+     amount of register tying.  This is especially helpful on machines
+     with two-operand instructions.  GCC enables this optimization by
+     default with `-O2' or higher.
+
+     Note `-fregmove' and `-foptimize-register-moves' are the same
+     optimization.
+
+`-fdelayed-branch'
+     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
+     instructions to exploit instruction slots available after delayed
+     branch instructions.
+
+`-fschedule-insns'
+     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
+     instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required data
+     being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow floating
+     point or memory load instructions by allowing other instructions
+     to be issued until the result of the load or floating point
+     instruction is required.
+
+`-fschedule-insns2'
+     Similar to `-fschedule-insns', but requests an additional pass of
+     instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.
+     This is especially useful on machines with a relatively small
+     number of registers and where memory load instructions take more
+     than one cycle.
+
+`-ffunction-sections'
+`-fdata-sections'
+     Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
+     file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
+     function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
+     in the output file.
+
+     Use these options on systems where the linker can perform
+     optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction
+     space.  HPPA processors running HP-UX and Sparc processors running
+     Solaris 2 have linkers with such optimizations.  Other systems
+     using the ELF object format as well as AIX may have these
+     optimizations in the future.
+
+     Only use these options when there are significant benefits from
+     doing so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and
+     linker will create larger object and executable files and will
+     also be slower.  You will not be able to use `gprof' on all
+     systems if you specify this option and you may have problems with
+     debugging if you specify both this option and `-g'.
+
+`-fcaller-saves'
+     Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered
+     by function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and
+     restore the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done
+     only when it seems to result in better code than would otherwise
+     be produced.
+
+     This option is always enabled by default on certain machines,
+     usually those which have no call-preserved registers to use
+     instead.
+
+     For all machines, optimization level 2 and higher enables this
+     flag by default.
+
+`-funroll-loops'
+     Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for
+     loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time
+     or run time.  `-funroll-loops' implies both `-fstrength-reduce' and
+     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.
+
+`-funroll-all-loops'
+     Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all
+     loops and usually makes programs run more slowly.
+     `-funroll-all-loops' implies `-fstrength-reduce' as well as
+     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.
+
+`-fmove-all-movables'
+     Forces all invariant computations in loops to be moved outside the
+     loop.
+
+`-freduce-all-givs'
+     Forces all general-induction variables in loops to be
+     strength-reduced.
+
+     *Note:* When compiling programs written in Fortran,
+     `-fmove-all-movables' and `-freduce-all-givs' are enabled by
+     default when you use the optimizer.
+
+     These options may generate better or worse code; results are highly
+     dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.
+
+     These two options are intended to be removed someday, once they
+     have helped determine the efficacy of various approaches to
+     improving loop optimizations.
+
+     Please let us (`gcc@gcc.gnu.org' and `fortran@gnu.org') know how
+     use of these options affects the performance of your production
+     code.  We're very interested in code that runs *slower* when these
+     options are *enabled*.
+
+`-fno-peephole'
+     Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.
+
+`-fbranch-probabilities'
+     After running a program compiled with `-fprofile-arcs' (*note
+     Options for Debugging Your Program or `gcc': Debugging Options.),
+     you can compile it a second time using `-fbranch-probabilities',
+     to improve optimizations based on guessing the path a branch might
+     take.
+
+     With `-fbranch-probabilities', GCC puts a `REG_EXEC_COUNT' note on
+     the first instruction of each basic block, and a `REG_BR_PROB'
+     note on each `JUMP_INSN' and `CALL_INSN'.  These can be used to
+     improve optimization.  Currently, they are only used in one place:
+     in `reorg.c', instead of guessing which path a branch is mostly to
+     take, the `REG_BR_PROB' values are used to exactly determine which
+     path is taken more often.
+
+`-fstrict-aliasing'
+     Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules
+     applicable to the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this
+     activates optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In
+     particular, an object of one type is assumed never to reside at
+     the same address as an object of a different type, unless the
+     types are almost the same.  For example, an `unsigned int' can
+     alias an `int', but not a `void*' or a `double'.  A character type
+     may alias any other type.
+
+     Pay special attention to code like this:
+          union a_union {
+            int i;
+            double d;
+          };
+          
+          int f() {
+            a_union t;
+            t.d = 3.0;
+            return t.i;
+          }
+     The practice of reading from a different union member than the one
+     most recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.  Even
+     with `-fstrict-aliasing', type-punning is allowed, provided the
+     memory is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above
+     will work as expected.  However, this code might not:
+          int f() {
+            a_union t;
+            int* ip;
+            t.d = 3.0;
+            ip = &t.i;
+            return *ip;
+          }
+
+     Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias
+     analysis should define a function that computes, given an `tree'
+     node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets
+     are not allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end
+     function `c_get_alias_set'.

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Preprocessor Options,  Next: Assembler Options,  Prev: Optimize Options,  Up: Invoking GCC
+
+Options Controlling the Preprocessor
+====================================
+
+   These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C
+source file before actual compilation.
+
+   If you use the `-E' option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
+Some of these options make sense only together with `-E' because they
+cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual compilation.
+
+`-include FILE'
+     Process FILE as input before processing the regular input file.
+     In effect, the contents of FILE are compiled first.  Any `-D' and
+     `-U' options on the command line are always processed before
+     `-include FILE', regardless of the order in which they are
+     written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options are processed
+     in the order in which they are written.
+
+`-imacros FILE'
+     Process FILE as input, discarding the resulting output, before
+     processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated
+     from FILE is discarded, the only effect of `-imacros FILE' is to
+     make the macros defined in FILE available for use in the main
+     input.
+
+     Any `-D' and `-U' options on the command line are always processed
+     before `-imacros FILE', regardless of the order in which they are
+     written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options are processed
+     in the order in which they are written.
+
+`-idirafter DIR'
+     Add the directory DIR to the second include path.  The directories
+     on the second include path are searched when a header file is not
+     found in any of the directories in the main include path (the one
+     that `-I' adds to).
+
+`-iprefix PREFIX'
+     Specify PREFIX as the prefix for subsequent `-iwithprefix' options.
+
+`-iwithprefix DIR'
+     Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name
+     is made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, where PREFIX was
+     specified previously with `-iprefix'.  If you have not specified a
+     prefix yet, the directory containing the installed passes of the
+     compiler is used as the default.
+
+`-iwithprefixbefore DIR'
+     Add a directory to the main include path.  The directory's name is
+     made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, as in the case of
+     `-iwithprefix'.
+
+`-isystem DIR'
+     Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path,
+     marking it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special
+     treatment as is applied to the standard system directories.
+
+`-nostdinc'
+     Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
+     Only the directories you have specified with `-I' options (and the
+     current directory, if appropriate) are searched.  *Note Directory
+     Options::, for information on `-I'.
+
+     By using both `-nostdinc' and `-I-', you can limit the include-file
+     search path to only those directories you specify explicitly.
+
+`-undef'
+     Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Including architecture
+     flags).
+
+`-E'
+     Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the C source files
+     specified and output the results to standard output or to the
+     specified output file.
+
+`-C'
+     Tell the preprocessor not to discard comments.  Used with the `-E'
+     option.
+
+`-P'
+     Tell the preprocessor not to generate `#line' directives.  Used
+     with the `-E' option.
+
+`-M'
+     Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for `make'
+     describing the dependencies of each object file.  For each source
+     file, the preprocessor outputs one `make'-rule whose target is the
+     object file name for that source file and whose dependencies are
+     all the `#include' header files it uses.  This rule may be a
+     single line or may be continued with `\'-newline if it is long.
+     The list of rules is printed on standard output instead of the
+     preprocessed C program.
+
+     `-M' implies `-E'.
+
+     Another way to specify output of a `make' rule is by setting the
+     environment variable `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' (*note Environment
+     Variables::.).
+
+`-MM'
+     Like `-M' but the output mentions only the user header files
+     included with `#include "FILE"'.  System header files included
+     with `#include <FILE>' are omitted.
+
+`-MD'
+     Like `-M' but the dependency information is written to a file made
+     by replacing ".c" with ".d" at the end of the input file names.
+     This is in addition to compiling the file as specified--`-MD' does
+     not inhibit ordinary compilation the way `-M' does.
+
+     In Mach, you can use the utility `md' to merge multiple dependency
+     files into a single dependency file suitable for using with the
+     `make' command.
+
+`-MMD'
+     Like `-MD' except mention only user header files, not system
+     header files.
+
+`-MG'
+     Treat missing header files as generated files and assume they live
+     in the same directory as the source file.  If you specify `-MG',
+     you must also specify either `-M' or `-MM'.  `-MG' is not
+     supported with `-MD' or `-MMD'.
+
+`-H'
+     Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
+     normal activities.
+
+`-AQUESTION(ANSWER)'
+     Assert the answer ANSWER for QUESTION, in case it is tested with a
+     preprocessing conditional such as `#if #QUESTION(ANSWER)'.  `-A-'
+     disables the standard assertions that normally describe the target
+     machine.
+
+`-DMACRO'
+     Define macro MACRO with the string `1' as its definition.
+
+`-DMACRO=DEFN'
+     Define macro MACRO as DEFN.  All instances of `-D' on the command
+     line are processed before any `-U' options.
+

+Passing Options to the Assembler
+================================
+
+   You can pass options to the assembler.
+
+`-Wa,OPTION'

+
+Options for Linking
+===================
+
+   These options come into play when the compiler links object files
+into an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
+not doing a link step.
+
+`OBJECT-FILE-NAME'
+     A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
+     considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
+     distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
+     contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as
+     input to the linker.
+
+`-c'
+`-S'
+`-E'
+     If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
+     object file names should not be used as arguments.  *Note Overall
+     Options::.
+
+`-lLIBRARY'
+     Search the library named LIBRARY when linking.
+
+     It makes a difference where in the command you write this option;
+     the linker searches processes libraries and object files in the
+     order they are specified.  Thus, `foo.o -lz bar.o' searches
+     library `z' after file `foo.o' but before `bar.o'.  If `bar.o'
+     refers to functions in `z', those functions may not be loaded.
+
+     The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
+     which is actually a file named `libLIBRARY.a'.  The linker then
+     uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
+
+     The directories searched include several standard system
+     directories plus any that you specify with `-L'.
+
+     Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
+     whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive
+     file by scanning through it for members which define symbols that
+     have so far been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that
+     is found is an ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual
+     fashion.  The only difference between using an `-l' option and
+     specifying a file name is that `-l' surrounds LIBRARY with `lib'
+     and `.a' and searches several directories.
+
+`-lobjc'
+     You need this special case of the `-l' option in order to link an
+     Objective C program.
+
+`-nostartfiles'
+     Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.  The
+     standard system libraries are used normally, unless `-nostdlib' or
+     `-nodefaultlibs' is used.
+
+`-nodefaultlibs'
+     Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only the
+     libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.  The standard
+     startup files are used normally, unless `-nostartfiles' is used.
+     The compiler may generate calls to memcmp, memset, and memcpy for
+     System V (and ANSI C) environments or to bcopy and bzero for BSD
+     environments.  These entries are usually resolved by entries in
+     libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
+     mechanism when this option is specified.
+
+`-nostdlib'
+     Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when
+     linking.  No startup files and only the libraries you specify will
+     be passed to the linker. The compiler may generate calls to
+     memcmp, memset, and memcpy for System V (and ANSI C) environments
+     or to bcopy and bzero for BSD environments.  These entries are
+     usually resolved by entries in libc.  These entry points should be
+     supplied through some other mechanism when this option is
+     specified.
+
+     One of the standard libraries bypassed by `-nostdlib' and
+     `-nodefaultlibs' is `libgcc.a', a library of internal subroutines
+     that GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or
+     special needs for some languages.  (*Note Interfacing to GCC
+     Output: Interface, for more discussion of `libgcc.a'.)  In most
+     cases, you need `libgcc.a' even when you want to avoid other
+     standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify `-nostdlib'
+     or `-nodefaultlibs' you should usually specify `-lgcc' as well.
+     This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
+     library subroutines.  (For example, `__main', used to ensure C++
+     constructors will be called; *note `collect2': Collect2..)
+
+`-s'
+     Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the
+     executable.
+
+`-static'
+     On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking
+     with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no
+     effect.
+
+`-shared'
+     Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other
+     objects to form an executable.  Not all systems support this
+     option.  You must also specify `-fpic' or `-fPIC' on some systems
+     when you specify this option.
+
+`-symbolic'
+     Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.
+     Warn about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the
+     link editor option `-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs').  Only a few
+     systems support this option.
+
+`-Xlinker OPTION'
+     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
+     supply system-specific linker options which GCC does not know how
+     to recognize.
+
+     If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
+     `-Xlinker' twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
+     For example, to pass `-assert definitions', you must write
+     `-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'.  It does not work to write
+     `-Xlinker "-assert definitions"', because this passes the entire
+     string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
+
+`-Wl,OPTION'
+     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  If OPTION contains
+     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
+
+`-u SYMBOL'
+     Pretend the symbol SYMBOL is undefined, to force linking of
+     library modules to define it.  You can use `-u' multiple times with
+     different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

+
+Options for Directory Search
+============================
+
+   These options specify directories to search for header files, for
+libraries and for parts of the compiler:
+
+`-IDIR'
+     Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
+     searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system
+     header file, substituting your own version, since these
+     directories are searched before the system header file
+     directories.  If you use more than one `-I' option, the
+     directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard
+     system directories come after.
+
+`-I-'
+     Any directories you specify with `-I' options before the `-I-'
+     option are searched only for the case of `#include "FILE"'; they
+     are not searched for `#include <FILE>'.
+
+     If additional directories are specified with `-I' options after
+     the `-I-', these directories are searched for all `#include'
+     directives.  (Ordinarily *all* `-I' directories are used this way.)
+
+     In addition, the `-I-' option inhibits the use of the current
+     directory (where the current input file came from) as the first
+     search directory for `#include "FILE"'.  There is no way to
+     override this effect of `-I-'.  With `-I.' you can specify
+     searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
+     invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor
+     does by default, but it is often satisfactory.
+
+     `-I-' does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
+     for header files.  Thus, `-I-' and `-nostdinc' are independent.
+
+`-LDIR'
+     Add directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched for
+     `-l'.
+
+`-BPREFIX'
+     This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
+     include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
+
+     The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
+     `cpp', `cc1', `as' and `ld'.  It tries PREFIX as a prefix for each
+     program it tries to run, both with and without `MACHINE/VERSION/'
+     (*note Target Options::.).
+
+     For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
+     `-B' prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if `-B' was
+     not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
+     `/usr/lib/gcc/' and `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/'.  If neither of
+     those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
+     name is searched for using the directories specified in your
+     `PATH' environment variable.
+
+     `-B' prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
+     to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
+     options into `-L' options for the linker.  They also apply to
+     includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler
+     translates these options into `-isystem' options for the
+     preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends `include' to the
+     prefix.
+
+     The run-time support file `libgcc.a' can also be searched for using
+     the `-B' prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
+     standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is
+     left out of the link if it is not found by those means.
+
+     Another way to specify a prefix much like the `-B' prefix is to use
+     the environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  *Note Environment
+     Variables::.
+
+`-specs=FILE'
+     Process FILE after the compiler reads in the standard `specs'
+     file, in order to override the defaults that the `gcc' driver
+     program uses when determining what switches to pass to `cc1',
+     `cc1plus', `as', `ld', etc.  More than one `-specs='FILE can be
+     specified on the command line, and they are processed in order,
+     from left to right.

+
+Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version
+==============================================
+
+   By default, GCC compiles code for the same type of machine that you
+are using.  However, it can also be installed as a cross-compiler, to
+compile for some other type of machine.  In fact, several different
+configurations of GCC, for different target machines, can be installed
+side by side.  Then you specify which one to use with the `-b' option.
+
+   In addition, older and newer versions of GCC can be installed side
+by side.  One of them (probably the newest) will be the default, but
+you may sometimes wish to use another.
+
+`-b MACHINE'
+     The argument MACHINE specifies the target machine for compilation.
+     This is useful when you have installed GCC as a cross-compiler.
+
+     The value to use for MACHINE is the same as was specified as the
+     machine type when configuring GCC as a cross-compiler.  For
+     example, if a cross-compiler was configured with `configure
+     i386v', meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
+     would specify `-b i386v' to run that cross compiler.
+
+     When you do not specify `-b', it normally means to compile for the
+     same type of machine that you are using.
+
+`-V VERSION'
+     The argument VERSION specifies which version of GCC to run.  This
+     is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
+     VERSION might be `2.0', meaning to run GCC version 2.0.
+
+     The default version, when you do not specify `-V', is the last
+     version of GCC that you installed.
+
+   The `-b' and `-V' options actually work by controlling part of the
+file name used for the executable files and libraries used for
+compilation.  A given version of GCC, for a given target machine, is
+normally kept in the directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/MACHINE/VERSION'.
+
+   Thus, sites can customize the effect of `-b' or `-V' either by
+changing the names of these directories or adding alternate names (or
+symbolic links).  If in directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/' the file
+`80386' is a link to the file `i386v', then `-b 80386' becomes an alias
+for `-b i386v'.
+
+   In one respect, the `-b' or `-V' do not completely change to a
+different compiler: the top-level driver program `gcc' that you
+originally invoked continues to run and invoke the other executables
+(preprocessor, compiler per se, assembler and linker) that do the real
+work.  However, since no real work is done in the driver program, it
+usually does not matter that the driver program in use is not the one
+for the specified target and version.
+
+   The only way that the driver program depends on the target machine is
+in the parsing and handling of special machine-specific options.
+However, this is controlled by a file which is found, along with the
+other executables, in the directory for the specified version and
+target machine.  As a result, a single installed driver program adapts
+to any specified target machine and compiler version.
+
+   The driver program executable does control one significant thing,
+however: the default version and target machine.  Therefore, you can
+install different instances of the driver program, compiled for
+different targets or versions, under different names.
+
+   For example, if the driver for version 2.0 is installed as `ogcc'
+and that for version 2.1 is installed as `gcc', then the command `gcc'
+will use version 2.1 by default, while `ogcc' will use 2.0 by default.
+However, you can choose either version with either command with the
+`-V' option.

+
+Hardware Models and Configurations
+==================================
+
+   Earlier we discussed the standard option `-b' which chooses among
+different installed compilers for completely different target machines,
+such as Vax vs. 68000 vs. 80386.
+
+   In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
+special options, starting with `-m', to choose among various hardware
+models or configurations--for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating
+coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the compiler can
+compile for any model or configuration, according to the options
+specified.
+
+   Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
+options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
+platform.
+
+   These options are defined by the macro `TARGET_SWITCHES' in the
+machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
+that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

+
+M680x0 Options
+--------------
+
+   These are the `-m' options defined for the 68000 series.  The default
+values for these options depends on which style of 68000 was selected
+when the compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common
+choices are given below.
+
+`-m68000'
+`-mc68000'
+     Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 68000-based systems.
+
+     Use this option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core,
+     including the 68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.
+
+`-m68020'
+`-mc68020'
+     Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 68020-based systems.
+
+`-m68881'
+     Generate output containing 68881 instructions for floating point.
+     This is the default for most 68020 systems unless `-nfp' was
+     specified when the compiler was configured.
+
+`-m68030'
+     Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 68030-based systems.
+
+`-m68040'
+     Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 68040-based systems.
+
+     This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have
+     to be emulated by software on the 68040.  Use this option if your
+     68040 does not have code to emulate those instructions.
+
+`-m68060'
+     Generate output for a 68060.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 68060-based systems.
+
+     This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882 instructions
+     that have to be emulated by software on the 68060.  Use this
+     option if your 68060 does not have code to emulate those
+     instructions.
+
+`-mcpu32'
+     Generate output for a CPU32. This is the default when the compiler
+     is configured for CPU32-based systems.
+
+     Use this option for microcontrollers with a CPU32 or CPU32+ core,
+     including the 68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334, 68336, 68340,
+     68341, 68349 and 68360.
+
+`-m5200'
+     Generate output for a 520X "coldfire" family cpu.  This is the
+     default when the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems.
+
+     Use this option for microcontroller with a 5200 core, including
+     the MCF5202, MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5202.
+
+`-m68020-40'
+     Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
+     instructions.  This results in code which can run relatively
+     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
+     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated
+     on the 68040.
+
+`-m68020-60'
+     Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new
+     instructions.  This results in code which can run relatively
+     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
+     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated
+     on the 68060.
+
+`-mfpa'
+     Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for floating point.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all m68k
+     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
+     compiler are used, but this can't be done directly in
+     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
+     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded
+     targets `m68k-*-aout' and `m68k-*-coff' do provide software
+     floating point support.
+
+`-mshort'
+     Consider type `int' to be 16 bits wide, like `short int'.
+
+`-mnobitfield'
+     Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68000', `-mcpu32'
+     and `-m5200' options imply `-mnobitfield'.
+
+`-mbitfield'
+     Do use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68020' option implies
+     `-mbitfield'.  This is the default if you use a configuration
+     designed for a 68020.
+
+`-mrtd'
+     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
+     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the `rtd'
+     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
+     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
+     the arguments there.
+
+     This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used
+     on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
+     compiled with the Unix compiler.
+
+     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
+     take variable numbers of arguments (including `printf'); otherwise
+     incorrect code will be generated for calls to those functions.
+
+     In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
+     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
+     harmlessly ignored.)
+
+     The `rtd' instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
+     68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.
+
+`-malign-int'
+`-mno-align-int'
+     Control whether GCC aligns `int', `long', `long long', `float',
+     `double', and `long double' variables on a 32-bit boundary
+     (`-malign-int') or a 16-bit boundary (`-mno-align-int').  Aligning
+     variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
+     faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more
+     memory.
+
+     *Warning:* if you use the `-malign-int' switch, GCC will align
+     structures containing the above types  differently than most
+     published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.

+VAX Options
+-----------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the Vax:
+
+`-munix'
+     Do not output certain jump instructions (`aobleq' and so on) that
+     the Unix assembler for the Vax cannot handle across long ranges.
+
+`-mgnu'
+     Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that you will
+     assemble with the GNU assembler.
+
+`-mg'
+     Output code for g-format floating point numbers instead of
+     d-format.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: SPARC Options,  Next: Convex Options,  Prev: VAX Options,  Up: Submodel Options
+
+SPARC Options
+-------------
+
+   These `-m' switches are supported on the SPARC:
+
+`-mno-app-regs'
+`-mapp-regs'
+     Specify `-mapp-regs' to generate output using the global registers
+     2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.
+     This is the default.
+
+     To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some performance
+     loss, specify `-mno-app-regs'.  You should compile libraries and
+     system software with this option.
+
+`-mfpu'
+`-mhard-float'
+     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
+     the default.
+
+`-mno-fpu'
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
+     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
+     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
+     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
+     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded
+     targets `sparc-*-aout' and `sparclite-*-*' do provide software
+     floating point support.
+
+     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
+     therefore, it is only useful if you compile *all* of a program with
+     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
+     library that comes with GCC, with `-msoft-float' in order for this
+     to work.
+
+`-mhard-quad-float'
+     Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
+     instructions.
+
+`-msoft-quad-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
+     double) floating point instructions.  The functions called are
+     those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.
+
+     As of this writing, there are no sparc implementations that have
+     hardware support for the quad-word floating point instructions.
+     They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions, and
+     then the trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction.
+     Because of the trap handler overhead, this is much slower than
+     calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the `-msoft-quad-float'
+     option is the default.
+
+`-mno-epilogue'
+`-mepilogue'
+     With `-mepilogue' (the default), the compiler always emits code for
+     function exit at the end of each function.  Any function exit in
+     the middle of the function (such as a return statement in C) will
+     generate a jump to the exit code at the end of the function.
+
+     With `-mno-epilogue', the compiler tries to emit exit code inline
+     at every function exit.
+
+`-mno-flat'
+`-mflat'
+     With `-mflat', the compiler does not generate save/restore
+     instructions and will use a "flat" or single register window
+     calling convention.  This model uses %i7 as the frame pointer and
+     is compatible with the normal register window model.  Code from
+     either may be intermixed.  The local registers and the input
+     registers (0-5) are still treated as "call saved" registers and
+     will be saved on the stack as necessary.
+
+     With `-mno-flat' (the default), the compiler emits save/restore
+     instructions (except for leaf functions) and is the normal mode of
+     operation.
+
+`-mno-unaligned-doubles'
+`-munaligned-doubles'
+     Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.
+
+     With `-munaligned-doubles', GCC assumes that doubles have 8 byte
+     alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they
+     have an absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte
+     alignment.  Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility
+     problems with code generated by other compilers.  It is not the
+     default because it results in a performance loss, especially for
+     floating point code.
+
+`-mv8'
+`-msparclite'
+     These two options select variations on the SPARC architecture.
+
+     By default (unless specifically configured for the Fujitsu
+     SPARClite), GCC generates code for the v7 variant of the SPARC
+     architecture.
+
+     `-mv8' will give you SPARC v8 code.  The only difference from v7
+     code is that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer
+     divide instructions which exist in SPARC v8 but not in SPARC v7.
+
+     `-msparclite' will give you SPARClite code.  This adds the integer
+     multiply, integer divide step and scan (`ffs') instructions which
+     exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC v7.
+
+     These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC
+     release.  They have been replaced with `-mcpu=xxx'.
+
+`-mcypress'
+`-msupersparc'
+     These two options select the processor for which the code is
+     optimised.
+
+     With `-mcypress' (the default), the compiler optimizes code for the
+     Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the SparcStation/SparcServer 3xx
+     series.  This is also appropriate for the older SparcStation 1, 2,
+     IPX etc.
+
+     With `-msupersparc' the compiler optimizes code for the SuperSparc
+     cpu, as used in the SparcStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series. This
+     flag also enables use of the full SPARC v8 instruction set.
+
+     These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC
+     release.  They have been replaced with `-mcpu=xxx'.
+
+`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
+     Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
+     parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  Supported values for
+     CPU_TYPE are `v7', `cypress', `v8', `supersparc', `sparclite',
+     `hypersparc', `sparclite86x', `f930', `f934', `sparclet',
+     `tsc701', `v9', and `ultrasparc'.
+
+     Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that
+     select an architecture and not an implementation.  These are `v7',
+     `v8', `sparclite', `sparclet', `v9'.
+
+     Here is a list of each supported architecture and their supported
+     implementations.
+
+              v7:             cypress
+              v8:             supersparc, hypersparc
+              sparclite:      f930, f934, sparclite86x
+              sparclet:       tsc701
+              v9:             ultrasparc
+
+`-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
+     Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
+     CPU_TYPE, but do not set the instruction set or register set that
+     the option `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE would.
+
+     The same values for `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE are used for `-mtune='
+     CPU_TYPE, though the only useful values are those that select a
+     particular cpu implementation: `cypress', `supersparc',
+     `hypersparc', `f930', `f934', `sparclite86x', `tsc701',
+     `ultrasparc'.
+
+`-malign-loops=NUM'
+     Align loops to a 2 raised to a NUM byte boundary.  If
+     `-malign-loops' is not specified, the default is 2.
+
+`-malign-jumps=NUM'
+     Align instructions that are only jumped to to a 2 raised to a NUM
+     byte boundary.  If `-malign-jumps' is not specified, the default
+     is 2.
+
+`-malign-functions=NUM'
+     Align the start of functions to a 2 raised to NUM byte boundary.
+     If `-malign-functions' is not specified, the default is 2 if
+     compiling for 32 bit sparc, and 5 if compiling for 64 bit sparc.
+
+   These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on the
+SPARCLET processor.
+
+`-mlittle-endian'
+     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.
+
+`-mlive-g0'
+     Treat register `%g0' as a normal register.  GCC will continue to
+     clobber it as necessary but will not assume it always reads as 0.
+
+`-mbroken-saverestore'
+     Generate code that does not use non-trivial forms of the `save' and
+     `restore' instructions.  Early versions of the SPARCLET processor
+     do not correctly handle `save' and `restore' instructions used with
+     arguments.  They correctly handle them used without arguments.  A
+     `save' instruction used without arguments increments the current
+     window pointer but does not allocate a new stack frame.  It is
+     assumed that the window overflow trap handler will properly handle
+     this case as will interrupt handlers.
+
+   These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on SPARC
+V9 processors in 64 bit environments.
+
+`-mlittle-endian'
+     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.
+
+`-m32'
+`-m64'
+     Generate code for a 32 bit or 64 bit environment.  The 32 bit
+     environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64 bit
+     environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.
+
+`-mcmodel=medlow'
+     Generate code for the Medium/Low code model: the program must be
+     linked in the low 32 bits of the address space.  Pointers are 64
+     bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.
+
+`-mcmodel=medmid'
+     Generate code for the Medium/Middle code model: the program must
+     be linked in the low 44 bits of the address space, the text
+     segment must be less than 2G bytes, and data segment must be
+     within 2G of the text segment.  Pointers are 64 bits.
+
+`-mcmodel=medany'
+     Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model: the program may
+     be linked anywhere in the address space, the text segment must be
+     less than 2G bytes, and data segment must be within 2G of the text
+     segment.  Pointers are 64 bits.
+
+`-mcmodel=embmedany'
+     Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded
+     systems: assume a 32 bit text and a 32 bit data segment, both
+     starting anywhere (determined at link time).  Register %g4 points
+     to the base of the data segment.  Pointers still 64 bits.
+     Programs are statically linked, PIC is not supported.
+
+`-mstack-bias'
+`-mno-stack-bias'
+     With `-mstack-bias', GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and frame
+     pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added back
+     when making stack frame references.  Otherwise, assume no such
+     offset is present.

+Convex Options
+--------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for Convex:
+
+`-mc1'
+     Generate output for C1.  The code will run on any Convex machine.
+     The preprocessor symbol `__convex__c1__' is defined.
+
+`-mc2'
+     Generate output for C2.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
+     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
+     on C2.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c2__' is defined.
+
+`-mc32'
+     Generate output for C32xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
+     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
+     on C32.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c32__' is defined.
+
+`-mc34'
+     Generate output for C34xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
+     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
+     on C34.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c34__' is defined.
+
+`-mc38'
+     Generate output for C38xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
+     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
+     on C38.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c38__' is defined.
+
+`-margcount'
+     Generate code which puts an argument count in the word preceding
+     each argument list.  This is compatible with regular CC, and a few
+     programs may need the argument count word.  GDB and other
+     source-level debuggers do not need it; this info is in the symbol
+     table.
+
+`-mnoargcount'
+     Omit the argument count word.  This is the default.
+
+`-mvolatile-cache'
+     Allow volatile references to be cached.  This is the default.
+
+`-mvolatile-nocache'
+     Volatile references bypass the data cache, going all the way to
+     memory.  This is only needed for multi-processor code that does
+     not use standard synchronization instructions.  Making
+     non-volatile references to volatile locations will not necessarily
+     work.
+
+`-mlong32'
+     Type long is 32 bits, the same as type int.  This is the default.
+
+`-mlong64'
+     Type long is 64 bits, the same as type long long.  This option is
+     useless, because no library support exists for it.

+
+AMD29K Options
+--------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the AMD Am29000:
+
+`-mdw'
+     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is set, i.e., that byte and
+     halfword operations are directly supported by the hardware.  This
+     is the default.
+
+`-mndw'
+     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is not set.
+
+`-mbw'
+     Generate code that assumes the system supports byte and halfword
+     write operations.  This is the default.
+
+`-mnbw'
+     Generate code that assumes the systems does not support byte and
+     halfword write operations.  `-mnbw' implies `-mndw'.
+
+`-msmall'
+     Use a small memory model that assumes that all function addresses
+     are either within a single 256 KB segment or at an absolute
+     address of less than 256k.  This allows the `call' instruction to
+     be used instead of a `const', `consth', `calli' sequence.
+
+`-mnormal'
+     Use the normal memory model: Generate `call' instructions only when
+     calling functions in the same file and `calli' instructions
+     otherwise.  This works if each file occupies less than 256 KB but
+     allows the entire executable to be larger than 256 KB.  This is
+     the default.
+
+`-mlarge'
+     Always use `calli' instructions.  Specify this option if you expect
+     a single file to compile into more than 256 KB of code.
+
+`-m29050'
+     Generate code for the Am29050.
+
+`-m29000'
+     Generate code for the Am29000.  This is the default.
+
+`-mkernel-registers'
+     Generate references to registers `gr64-gr95' instead of to
+     registers `gr96-gr127'.  This option can be used when compiling
+     kernel code that wants a set of global registers disjoint from
+     that used by user-mode code.
+
+     Note that when this option is used, register names in `-f' flags
+     must use the normal, user-mode, names.
+
+`-muser-registers'
+     Use the normal set of global registers, `gr96-gr127'.  This is the
+     default.
+
+`-mstack-check'
+`-mno-stack-check'
+     Insert (or do not insert) a call to `__msp_check' after each stack
+     adjustment.  This is often used for kernel code.
+
+`-mstorem-bug'
+`-mno-storem-bug'
+     `-mstorem-bug' handles 29k processors which cannot handle the
+     separation of a mtsrim insn and a storem instruction (most 29000
+     chips to date, but not the 29050).
+
+`-mno-reuse-arg-regs'
+`-mreuse-arg-regs'
+     `-mno-reuse-arg-regs' tells the compiler to only use incoming
+     argument registers for copying out arguments.  This helps detect
+     calling a function with fewer arguments than it was declared with.
+
+`-mno-impure-text'
+`-mimpure-text'
+     `-mimpure-text', used in addition to `-shared', tells the compiler
+     to not pass `-assert pure-text' to the linker when linking a
+     shared object.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.  Normally
+     the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
+     this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
+     your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
+     cross-compilation.
+
+`-mno-multm'
+     Do not generate multm or multmu instructions.  This is useful for
+     some embedded systems which do not have trap handlers for these
+     instructions.

+
+ARM Options
+-----------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
+architectures:
+
+`-mapcs-frame'
+     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure
+     Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly
+     necessary for correct execution of the code.  Specifying
+     `-fomit-frame-pointer' with this option will cause the stack
+     frames not to be generated for leaf functions.  The default is
+     `-mno-apcs-frame'.
+
+`-mapcs'
+     This is a synonym for `-mapcs-frame'.
+
+`-mapcs-26'
+     Generate code for a processor running with a 26-bit program
+     counter, and conforming to the function calling standards for the
+     APCS 26-bit option.  This option replaces the `-m2' and `-m3'
+     options of previous releases of the compiler.
+
+`-mapcs-32'
+     Generate code for a processor running with a 32-bit program
+     counter, and conforming to the function calling standards for the
+     APCS 32-bit option.  This option replaces the `-m6' option of
+     previous releases of the compiler.
+
+`-mapcs-stack-check'
+     Generate code to check the amount of stack space available upon
+     entry to every function (that actually uses some stack space).  If
+     there is insufficient space available then either the function
+     `__rt_stkovf_split_small' or `__rt_stkovf_split_big' will be
+     called, depending upon the amount of stack space required.  The
+     run time system is required to provide these functions.  The
+     default is `-mno-apcs-stack-check', since this produces smaller
+     code.
+
+`-mapcs-float'
+     Pass floating point arguments using the float point registers.
+     This is one of the variants of the APCS.  This option is
+     reccommended if the target hardware has a floating point unit or
+     if a lot of floating point arithmetic is going to be performed by
+     the code.  The default is `-mno-apcs-float', since integer only
+     code is slightly increased in size if `-mapcs-float' is used.
+
+`-mapcs-reentrant'
+     Generate reentrant, position independent code.  This is the
+     equivalent to specifying the `-fpic' option.  The default is
+     `-mno-apcs-reentrant'.
+
+`-mthumb-interwork'
+     Generate code which supports calling between the ARM and THUMB
+     instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets
+     cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
+     `-mno-thumb-interwork', since slightly larger code is generated
+     when `-mthumb-interwork' is specified.
+
+`-mno-sched-prolog'
+     Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or
+     the merging of those instruction with the instructions in the
+     function's body.  This means that all functions will start with a
+     recognisable set of instructions (or in fact one of a chioce from
+     a small set of different function prologues), and this information
+     can be used to locate the start if functions inside an executable
+     piece of code.  The default is `-msched-prolog'.
+
+`-mhard-float'
+     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
+     the default.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all ARM
+     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
+     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
+     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
+     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.
+
+     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
+     therefore, it is only useful if you compile *all* of a program with
+     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
+     library that comes with GCC, with `-msoft-float' in order for this
+     to work.
+
+`-mlittle-endian'
+     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This
+     is the default for all standard configurations.
+
+`-mbig-endian'
+     Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the
+     default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.
+
+`-mwords-little-endian'
+     This option only applies when generating code for big-endian
+     processors.  Generate code for a little-endian word order but a
+     big-endian byte order.  That is, a byte order of the form
+     `32107654'.  Note: this option should only be used if you require
+     compatibility with code for big-endian ARM processors generated by
+     versions of the compiler prior to 2.8.
+
+`-mshort-load-bytes'
+     Do not try to load half-words (eg `short's) by loading a word from
+     an unaligned address.  For some targets the MMU is configured to
+     trap unaligned loads; use this option to generate code that is
+     safe in these environments.
+
+`-mno-short-load-bytes'
+     Use unaligned word loads to load half-words (eg `short's).  This
+     option produces more efficient code, but the MMU is sometimes
+     configured to trap these instructions.
+
+`-mshort-load-words'
+     This is a synonym for the `-mno-short-load-bytes'.
+
+`-mno-short-load-words'
+     This is a synonym for the `-mshort-load-bytes'.
+
+`-mbsd'
+     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native BSD-mode
+     compiler.  This is the default if `-ansi' is not specified.
+
+`-mxopen'
+     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native
+     X/Open-mode compiler.
+
+`-mno-symrename'
+     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Do not run the assembler
+     post-processor, `symrename', after code has been assembled.
+     Normally it is necessary to modify some of the standard symbols in
+     preparation for linking with the RISC iX C library; this option
+     suppresses this pass.  The post-processor is never run when the
+     compiler is built for cross-compilation.
+
+`-mcpu=<name>'
+`-mtune=<name>'
+     This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses
+     this name to determine what kind of instructions it can use when
+     generating assembly code.  Permissable names are: arm2, arm250,
+     arm3, arm6, arm60, arm600, arm610, arm620, arm7, arm7m, arm7d,
+     arm7dm, arm7di, arm7dmi, arm70, arm700, arm700i, arm710, arm710c,
+     arm7100, arm7500, arm7500fe, arm7tdmi, arm8, strongarm,
+     strongarm110, strongarm1100, arm8, arm810, arm9, arm9tdmi.
+     `-mtune=' is a synonym for `-mcpue=' to support older versions of
+     GCC.
+
+`-march=<name>'
+     This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses
+     this name to determine what kind of instructions it can use when
+     generating assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction
+     with or instead of the `-mcpu=' option.  Permissable names are:
+     armv2, armv2a, armv3, armv3m, armv4, armv4t
+
+`-mfpe=<number>'
+`-mfp=<number>'
+     This specifes the version of the floating point emulation
+     available on the target.  Permissable values are 2 and 3.  `-mfp='
+     is a synonym for `-mfpe=' to support older versions of GCC.
+
+`-mstructure-size-boundary=<n>'
+     The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a
+     multiple of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissable
+     values are 8 and 32.  The default value varies for different
+     toolchains.  For the COFF targeted toolchain the default value is
+     8.  Specifying the larger number can produced faster, more
+     efficient code, but can also increase the size of the program.
+     The two values are potentially incompatible.  Code compiled with
+     one value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or libraries
+     compiled with the other value, if they exchange information using
+     structures or unions.  Programmers are encouraged to use the 32
+     value as future versions of the toolchain may default to this
+     value.
+
+`-mabort-on-noreturn'
+     Generate a call to the function abort at the end of a noreturn
+     function.  It will be executed if the function tries to return.

+Thumb Options
+-------------
+
+`-mthumb-interwork'
+     Generate code which supports calling between the THUMB and ARM
+     instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets
+     cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
+     `-mno-thumb-interwork', since slightly smaller code is generated
+     with this option.
+
+`-mtpcs-frame'
+     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
+     Call Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one
+     that does not call any other functions).  The default is
+     `-mno-apcs-frame'.
+
+`-mtpcs-leaf-frame'
+     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
+     Call Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one

+     `-mno-apcs-leaf-frame'.
+
+`-mlittle-endian'
+     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This
+     is the default for all standard configurations.
+
+`-mbig-endian'
+     Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode.
+
+`-mstructure-size-boundary=<n>'
+     The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a
+     multiple of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissable
+     values are 8 and 32.  The default value varies for different

+M32R/D Options
+--------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for Mitsubishi M32R/D architectures:
+
+`-mcode-model=small'
+     Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
+     addresses can be loaded with the `ld24' instruction), and assume
+     all subroutines are reachable with the `bl' instruction.  This is
+     the default.
+
+     The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
+     `model' attribute.
+
+`-mcode-model=medium'
+     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the
+     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
+     addresses), and assume all subroutines are reachable with the `bl'
+     instruction.
+
+`-mcode-model=large'
+     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the
+     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
+     addresses), and assume subroutines may not be reachable with the
+     `bl' instruction (the compiler will generate the much slower
+     `seth/add3/jl' instruction sequence).
+
+`-msdata=none'
+     Disable use of the small data area.  Variables will be put into
+     one of `.data', `bss', or `.rodata' (unless the `section'
+     attribute has been specified).  This is the default.
+
+     The small data area consists of sections `.sdata' and `.sbss'.
+     Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
+     `section' attribute using one of these sections.
+
+`-msdata=sdata'
+     Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
+     generate special code to reference them.
+
+`-msdata=use'
+     Put small global and static data in the small data area, and
+     generate special instructions to reference them.
+
+`-G NUM'
+     Put global and static objects less than or equal to NUM bytes into
+     the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
+     sections.  The default value of NUM is 8.  The `-msdata' option
+     must be set to one of `sdata' or `use' for this option to have any
+     effect.
+
+     All modules should be compiled with the same `-G NUM' value.
+     Compiling with different values of NUM may or may not work; if it
+     doesn't the linker will give an error message - incorrect code
+     will not be generated.

+M88K Options
+------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for Motorola 88k architectures:
+
+`-m88000'
+     Generate code that works well on both the m88100 and the m88110.
+
+`-m88100'
+     Generate code that works best for the m88100, but that also runs
+     on the m88110.
+
+`-m88110'
+     Generate code that works best for the m88110, and may not run on
+     the m88100.
+
+`-mbig-pic'
+     Obsolete option to be removed from the next revision.  Use `-fPIC'.
+
+`-midentify-revision'
+     Include an `ident' directive in the assembler output recording the
+     source file name, compiler name and version, timestamp, and
+     compilation flags used.
+
+`-mno-underscores'
+     In assembler output, emit symbol names without adding an underscore
+     character at the beginning of each name.  The default is to use an
+     underscore as prefix on each name.
+
+`-mocs-debug-info'
+`-mno-ocs-debug-info'
+     Include (or omit) additional debugging information (about
+     registers used in each stack frame) as specified in the 88open
+     Object Compatibility Standard, "OCS".  This extra information
+     allows debugging of code that has had the frame pointer
+     eliminated.  The default for DG/UX, SVr4, and Delta 88 SVr3.2 is
+     to include this information; other 88k configurations omit this
+     information by default.
+
+`-mocs-frame-position'
+     When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables
+     and parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the
+     canonical frame address, which is the stack pointer (register 31)
+     on entry to the function.  The DG/UX, SVr4, Delta88 SVr3.2, and
+     BCS configurations use `-mocs-frame-position'; other 88k
+     configurations have the default `-mno-ocs-frame-position'.
+
+`-mno-ocs-frame-position'
+     When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables
+     and parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the frame
+     pointer register (register 30).  When this option is in effect,
+     the frame pointer is not eliminated when debugging information is
+     selected by the -g switch.
+
+`-moptimize-arg-area'
+`-mno-optimize-arg-area'
+     Control how function arguments are stored in stack frames.
+     `-moptimize-arg-area' saves space by optimizing them, but this
+     conflicts with the 88open specifications.  The opposite
+     alternative, `-mno-optimize-arg-area', agrees with 88open
+     standards.  By default GCC does not optimize the argument area.
+
+`-mshort-data-NUM'
+     Generate smaller data references by making them relative to `r0',
+     which allows loading a value using a single instruction (rather
+     than the usual two).  You control which data references are
+     affected by specifying NUM with this option.  For example, if you
+     specify `-mshort-data-512', then the data references affected are
+     those involving displacements of less than 512 bytes.
+     `-mshort-data-NUM' is not effective for NUM greater than 64k.
+
+`-mserialize-volatile'
+`-mno-serialize-volatile'
+     Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee sequential consistency of
+     volatile memory references.  By default, consistency is guaranteed.
+
+     The order of memory references made by the MC88110 processor does
+     not always match the order of the instructions requesting those
+     references.  In particular, a load instruction may execute before
+     a preceding store instruction.  Such reordering violates
+     sequential consistency of volatile memory references, when there
+     are multiple processors.   When consistency must be guaranteed,
+     GNU C generates special instructions, as needed, to force
+     execution in the proper order.
+
+     The MC88100 processor does not reorder memory references and so
+     always provides sequential consistency.  However, by default, GNU
+     C generates the special instructions to guarantee consistency even
+     when you use `-m88100', so that the code may be run on an MC88110
+     processor.  If you intend to run your code only on the MC88100
+     processor, you may use `-mno-serialize-volatile'.
+
+     The extra code generated to guarantee consistency may affect the
+     performance of your application.  If you know that you can safely
+     forgo this guarantee, you may use `-mno-serialize-volatile'.
+
+`-msvr4'
+`-msvr3'
+     Turn on (`-msvr4') or off (`-msvr3') compiler extensions related
+     to System V release 4 (SVr4).  This controls the following:
+
+       1. Which variant of the assembler syntax to emit.
+
+       2. `-msvr4' makes the C preprocessor recognize `#pragma weak'
+          that is used on System V release 4.
+
+       3. `-msvr4' makes GCC issue additional declaration directives
+          used in SVr4.
+
+     `-msvr4' is the default for the m88k-motorola-sysv4 and
+     m88k-dg-dgux m88k configurations. `-msvr3' is the default for all
+     other m88k configurations.
+
+`-mversion-03.00'
+     This option is obsolete, and is ignored.
+
+`-mno-check-zero-division'
+`-mcheck-zero-division'
+     Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee that integer division by
+     zero will be detected.  By default, detection is guaranteed.
+
+     Some models of the MC88100 processor fail to trap upon integer
+     division by zero under certain conditions.  By default, when
+     compiling code that might be run on such a processor, GNU C
+     generates code that explicitly checks for zero-valued divisors and
+     traps with exception number 503 when one is detected.  Use of
+     mno-check-zero-division suppresses such checking for code
+     generated to run on an MC88100 processor.
+
+     GNU C assumes that the MC88110 processor correctly detects all
+     instances of integer division by zero.  When `-m88110' is
+     specified, both `-mcheck-zero-division' and
+     `-mno-check-zero-division' are ignored, and no explicit checks for
+     zero-valued divisors are generated.
+
+`-muse-div-instruction'
+     Use the div instruction for signed integer division on the MC88100
+     processor.  By default, the div instruction is not used.
+
+     On the MC88100 processor the signed integer division instruction
+     div) traps to the operating system on a negative operand.  The
+     operating system transparently completes the operation, but at a
+     large cost in execution time.  By default, when compiling code
+     that might be run on an MC88100 processor, GNU C emulates signed
+     integer division using the unsigned integer division instruction
+     divu), thereby avoiding the large penalty of a trap to the
+     operating system.  Such emulation has its own, smaller, execution
+     cost in both time and space.  To the extent that your code's
+     important signed integer division operations are performed on two
+     nonnegative operands, it may be desirable to use the div
+     instruction directly.
+
+     On the MC88110 processor the div instruction (also known as the
+     divs instruction) processes negative operands without trapping to
+     the operating system.  When `-m88110' is specified,
+     `-muse-div-instruction' is ignored, and the div instruction is used
+     for signed integer division.
+
+     Note that the result of dividing INT_MIN by -1 is undefined.  In
+     particular, the behavior of such a division with and without
+     `-muse-div-instruction'  may differ.
+
+`-mtrap-large-shift'
+`-mhandle-large-shift'
+     Include code to detect bit-shifts of more than 31 bits;
+     respectively, trap such shifts or emit code to handle them
+     properly.  By default GCC makes no special provision for large bit
+     shifts.
+
+`-mwarn-passed-structs'
+     Warn when a function passes a struct as an argument or result.
+     Structure-passing conventions have changed during the evolution of
+     the C language, and are often the source of portability problems.
+     By default, GCC issues no such warning.

+IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC Options
+-------------------------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:
+`-mpower'
+`-mno-power'
+`-mpower2'
+`-mno-power2'
+`-mpowerpc'
+`-mno-powerpc'
+`-mpowerpc-gpopt'
+`-mno-powerpc-gpopt'
+`-mpowerpc-gfxopt'
+`-mno-powerpc-gfxopt'
+`-mpowerpc64'
+`-mno-powerpc64'
+     GCC supports two related instruction set architectures for the
+     RS/6000 and PowerPC.  The "POWER" instruction set are those
+     instructions supported by the `rios' chip set used in the original
+     RS/6000 systems and the "PowerPC" instruction set is the
+     architecture of the Motorola MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx
+     microprocessors, and the IBM 4xx microprocessors.
+
+     Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
+     large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An MQ
+     register is included in processors supporting the POWER
+     architecture.
+
+     You use these options to specify which instructions are available
+     on the processor you are using.  The default value of these
+     options is determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
+     `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' overrides the specification of these options.  We
+     recommend you use the `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' option rather than the
+     options listed above.
+
+     The `-mpower' option allows GCC to generate instructions that are
+     found only in the POWER architecture and to use the MQ register.
+     Specifying `-mpower2' implies `-power' and also allows GCC to
+     generate instructions that are present in the POWER2 architecture
+     but not the original POWER architecture.
+
+     The `-mpowerpc' option allows GCC to generate instructions that
+     are found only in the 32-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
+     Specifying `-mpowerpc-gpopt' implies `-mpowerpc' and also allows
+     GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
+     General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.
+     Specifying `-mpowerpc-gfxopt' implies `-mpowerpc' and also allows
+     GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
+     Graphics group, including floating-point select.
+
+     The `-mpowerpc64' option allows GCC to generate the additional
+     64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64
+     architecture and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.
+     GCC defaults to `-mno-powerpc64'.
+
+     If you specify both `-mno-power' and `-mno-powerpc', GCC will use
+     only the instructions in the common subset of both architectures
+     plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and will not use the MQ
+     register.  Specifying both `-mpower' and `-mpowerpc' permits GCC
+     to use any instruction from either architecture and to allow use
+     of the MQ register; specify this for the Motorola MPC601.
+
+`-mnew-mnemonics'
+`-mold-mnemonics'
+     Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.
+     `-mnew-mnemonics' requests output that uses the assembler mnemonics
+     defined for the PowerPC architecture, while `-mold-mnemonics'
+     requests the assembler mnemonics defined for the POWER
+     architecture.  Instructions defined in only one architecture have
+     only one mnemonic; GCC uses that mnemonic irrespective of which of
+     these options is specified.
+
+     GCC defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in
+     use.  Specifying `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' sometimes overrides the value of
+     these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler, you
+     should normally not specify either `-mnew-mnemonics' or
+     `-mold-mnemonics', but should instead accept the default.
+
+`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
+     Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics, and
+     instruction scheduling parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.
+     Supported values for CPU_TYPE are `rs6000', `rios1', `rios2',
+     `rsc', `601', `602', `603', `603e', `604', `604e', `620', `740',
+     `750', `power', `power2', `powerpc', `403', `505', `801', `821',
+     `823', and `860' and `common'.  `-mcpu=power', `-mcpu=power2', and
+     `-mcpu=powerpc' specify generic POWER, POWER2 and pure PowerPC
+     (i.e., not MPC601) architecture machine types, with an appropriate,
+     generic processor model assumed for scheduling purposes.
+
+     Specifying any of the following options: `-mcpu=rios1',
+     `-mcpu=rios2', `-mcpu=rsc', `-mcpu=power', or `-mcpu=power2'
+     enables the `-mpower' option and disables the `-mpowerpc' option;
+     `-mcpu=601' enables both the `-mpower' and `-mpowerpc' options.
+     All of `-mcpu=602', `-mcpu=603', `-mcpu=603e', `-mcpu=604',
+     `-mcpu=620', enable the `-mpowerpc' option and disable the
+     `-mpower' option.  Exactly similarly, all of `-mcpu=403',
+     `-mcpu=505', `-mcpu=821', `-mcpu=860' and `-mcpu=powerpc' enable
+     the `-mpowerpc' option and disable the `-mpower' option.
+     `-mcpu=common' disables both the `-mpower' and `-mpowerpc' options.
+
+     AIX versions 4 or greater selects `-mcpu=common' by default, so
+     that code will operate on all members of the RS/6000 and PowerPC
+     families.  In that case, GCC will use only the instructions in the
+     common subset of both architectures plus some special AIX
+     common-mode calls, and will not use the MQ register.  GCC assumes
+     a generic processor model for scheduling purposes.
+
+     Specifying any of the options `-mcpu=rios1', `-mcpu=rios2',
+     `-mcpu=rsc', `-mcpu=power', or `-mcpu=power2' also disables the
+     `new-mnemonics' option.  Specifying `-mcpu=601', `-mcpu=602',
+     `-mcpu=603', `-mcpu=603e', `-mcpu=604', `620', `403', or
+     `-mcpu=powerpc' also enables the `new-mnemonics' option.
+
+     Specifying `-mcpu=403', `-mcpu=821', or `-mcpu=860' also enables
+     the `-msoft-float' option.
+
+`-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
+     Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
+     CPU_TYPE, but do not set the architecture type, register usage,
+     choice of mnemonics like `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE would.  The same values
+     for CPU_TYPE are used for `-mtune='CPU_TYPE as for
+     `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE.  The `-mtune='CPU_TYPE option overrides the
+     `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE option in terms of instruction scheduling
+     parameters.
+
+`-mfull-toc'
+`-mno-fp-in-toc'
+`-mno-sum-in-toc'
+`-mminimal-toc'
+     Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created
+     for every executable file.  The `-mfull-toc' option is selected by
+     default.  In that case, GCC will allocate at least one TOC entry
+     for each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.
+     GCC will also place floating-point constants in the TOC.  However,
+     only 16,384 entries are available in the TOC.
+
+     If you receive a linker error message that saying you have
+     overflowed the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of
+     TOC space used with the `-mno-fp-in-toc' and `-mno-sum-in-toc'
+     options.  `-mno-fp-in-toc' prevents GCC from putting floating-point
+     constants in the TOC and `-mno-sum-in-toc' forces GCC to generate
+     code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at run-time
+     instead of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one or
+     both of these options.  Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
+     slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.
+
+     If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify
+     both of these options, specify `-mminimal-toc' instead.  This
+     option causes GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When
+     you specify this option, GCC will produce code that is slower and
+     larger but which uses extremely little TOC space.  You may wish to
+     use this option only on files that contain less frequently
+     executed code.
+
+`-maix64'
+`-maix32'
+     Enable AIX 64-bit ABI and calling convention: 64-bit pointers,
+     64-bit `long' type, and the infrastructure needed to support them.
+     Specifying `-maix64' implies `-mpowerpc64' and `-mpowerpc', while
+     `-maix32' disables the 64-bit ABI and implies `-mno-powerpc64'.
+     GCC defaults to `-maix32'.
+
+`-mxl-call'
+`-mno-xl-call'
+     On AIX, pass floating-point arguments to prototyped functions
+     beyond the register save area (RSA) on the stack in addition to
+     argument FPRs.  The AIX calling convention was extended but not
+     initially documented to handle an obscure K&R C case of calling a
+     function that takes the address of its arguments with fewer
+     arguments than declared.  AIX XL compilers access floating point
+     arguments which do not fit in the RSA from the stack when a
+     subroutine is compiled without optimization.  Because always
+     storing floating-point arguments on the stack is inefficient and
+     rarely needed, this option is not enabled by default and only is
+     necessary when calling subroutines compiled by AIX XL compilers
+     without optimization.
+
+`-mthreads'
+     Support "AIX Threads".  Link an application written to use
+     "pthreads" with special libraries and startup code to enable the
+     application to run.
+
+`-mpe'
+     Support "IBM RS/6000 SP" "Parallel Environment" (PE).  Link an
+     application written to use message passing with special startup
+     code to enable the application to run.  The system must have PE
+     installed in the standard location (`/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/'), or the
+     `specs' file must be overridden with the `-specs=' option to
+     specify the appropriate directory location.  The Parallel
+     Environment does not support threads, so the `-mpe' option and the
+     `-mthreads' option are incompatible.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+`-mhard-float'
+     Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register
+     set.  Software floating point emulation is provided if you use the
+     `-msoft-float' option, and pass the option to GCC when linking.
+
+`-mmultiple'
+`-mno-multiple'
+     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
+     instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
+     instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and not
+     generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use `-mmultiple' on little
+     endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when
+     the processor is in little endian mode.  The exceptions are PPC740
+     and PPC750 which permit the instructions usage in little endian
+     mode.
+
+`-mstring'
+`-mno-string'
+     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string instructions
+     and the store string word instructions to save multiple registers
+     and do small block moves.  These instructions are generated by
+     default on POWER systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems.
+     Do not use `-mstring' on little endian PowerPC systems, since those
+     instructions do not work when the processor is in little endian
+     mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit the
+     instructions usage in little endian mode.
+
+`-mupdate'
+`-mno-update'
+     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store
+     instructions that update the base register to the address of the
+     calculated memory location.  These instructions are generated by
+     default.  If you use `-mno-update', there is a small window
+     between the time that the stack pointer is updated and the address
+     of the previous frame is stored, which means code that walks the
+     stack frame across interrupts or signals may get corrupted data.
+
+`-mfused-madd'
+`-mno-fused-madd'
+     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating point multiply
+     and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by
+     default if hardware floating is used.
+
+`-mno-bit-align'
+`-mbit-align'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force
+     structures and unions that contain bit fields to be aligned to the
+     base type of the bit field.
+
+     For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8
+     `unsigned' bitfields of length 1 would be aligned to a 4 byte
+     boundary and have a size of 4 bytes.  By using `-mno-bit-align',
+     the structure would be aligned to a 1 byte boundary and be one
+     byte in size.
+
+`-mno-strict-align'
+`-mstrict-align'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
+     unaligned memory references will be handled by the system.
+
+`-mrelocatable'
+`-mno-relocatable'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not
+     allow) the program to be relocated to a different address at
+     runtime.  If you use `-mrelocatable' on any module, all objects
+     linked together must be compiled with `-mrelocatable' or
+     `-mrelocatable-lib'.
+
+`-mrelocatable-lib'
+`-mno-relocatable-lib'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not
+     allow) the program to be relocated to a different address at
+     runtime.  Modules compiled with `-mrelocatable-lib' can be linked
+     with either modules compiled without `-mrelocatable' and
+     `-mrelocatable-lib' or with modules compiled with the
+     `-mrelocatable' options.
+
+`-mno-toc'
+`-mtoc'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
+     register 2 contains a pointer to a global area pointing to the
+     addresses used in the program.
+
+`-mlittle'
+`-mlittle-endian'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
+     processor in little endian mode.  The `-mlittle-endian' option is
+     the same as `-mlittle'.
+
+`-mbig'
+`-mbig-endian'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
+     processor in big endian mode.  The `-mbig-endian' option is the
+     same as `-mbig'.
+
+`-mcall-sysv'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using
+     calling conventions that adheres to the March 1995 draft of the
+     System V Application Binary Interface, PowerPC processor
+     supplement.  This is the default unless you configured GCC using
+     `powerpc-*-eabiaix'.
+
+`-mcall-sysv-eabi'
+     Specify both `-mcall-sysv' and `-meabi' options.
+
+`-mcall-sysv-noeabi'
+     Specify both `-mcall-sysv' and `-mno-eabi' options.
+
+`-mcall-aix'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using
+     calling conventions that are similar to those used on AIX.  This
+     is the default if you configured GCC using `powerpc-*-eabiaix'.
+
+`-mcall-solaris'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
+     Solaris operating system.
+
+`-mcall-linux'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
+     Linux-based GNU system.
+
+`-mprototype'
+`-mno-prototype'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all calls to
+     variable argument functions are properly prototyped.  Otherwise,
+     the compiler must insert an instruction before every non
+     prototyped call to set or clear bit 6 of the condition code
+     register (CR) to indicate whether floating point values were
+     passed in the floating point registers in case the function takes
+     a variable arguments.  With `-mprototype', only calls to
+     prototyped variable argument functions will set or clear the bit.
+
+`-msim'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
+     called `sim-crt0.o' and that the standard C libraries are
+     `libsim.a' and `libc.a'.  This is the default for
+     `powerpc-*-eabisim'.  configurations.
+
+`-mmvme'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
+     called `crt0.o' and the standard C libraries are `libmvme.a' and
+     `libc.a'.
+
+`-mads'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
+     called `crt0.o' and the standard C libraries are `libads.a' and
+     `libc.a'.
+
+`-myellowknife'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
+     called `crt0.o' and the standard C libraries are `libyk.a' and
+     `libc.a'.
+
+`-memb'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems, set the PPC_EMB bit in the ELF flags
+     header to indicate that `eabi' extended relocations are used.
+
+`-meabi'
+`-mno-eabi'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to
+     the Embedded Applications Binary Interface (eabi) which is a set of
+     modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting `-meabi'
+     means that the stack is aligned to an 8 byte boundary, a function
+     `__eabi' is called to from `main' to set up the eabi environment,
+     and the `-msdata' option can use both `r2' and `r13' to point to
+     two separate small data areas.  Selecting `-mno-eabi' means that
+     the stack is aligned to a 16 byte boundary, do not call an
+     initialization function from `main', and the `-msdata' option will
+     only use `r13' to point to a single small data area.  The `-meabi'
+     option is on by default if you configured GCC using one of the
+     `powerpc*-*-eabi*' options.
+
+`-msdata=eabi'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small initialized
+     `const' global and static data in the `.sdata2' section, which is
+     pointed to by register `r2'.  Put small initialized non-`const'
+     global and static data in the `.sdata' section, which is pointed
+     to by register `r13'.  Put small uninitialized global and static
+     data in the `.sbss' section, which is adjacent to the `.sdata'
+     section.  The `-msdata=eabi' option is incompatible with the
+     `-mrelocatable' option.  The `-msdata=eabi' option also sets the
+     `-memb' option.
+
+`-msdata=sysv'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and
+     static data in the `.sdata' section, which is pointed to by
+     register `r13'.  Put small uninitialized global and static data in
+     the `.sbss' section, which is adjacent to the `.sdata' section.
+     The `-msdata=sysv' option is incompatible with the `-mrelocatable'
+     option.
+
+`-msdata=default'
+`-msdata'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, if `-meabi' is used,
+     compile code the same as `-msdata=eabi', otherwise compile code the
+     same as `-msdata=sysv'.
+
+`-msdata-data'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and
+     static data in the `.sdata' section.  Put small uninitialized
+     global and static data in the `.sbss' section.  Do not use
+     register `r13' to address small data however.  This is the default
+     behavior unless other `-msdata' options are used.
+
+`-msdata=none'
+`-mno-sdata'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and static
+     data in the `.data' section, and all uninitialized data in the
+     `.bss' section.
+
+`-G NUM'
+     On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less than
+     or equal to NUM bytes into the small data or bss sections instead
+     of the normal data or bss section.  By default, NUM is 8.  The `-G
+     NUM' switch is also passed to the linker.  All modules should be
+     compiled with the same `-G NUM' value.
+
+`-mregnames'
+`-mno-regnames'
+     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit
+     register names in the assembly language output using symbolic
+     forms.

+
+IBM RT Options
+--------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the IBM RT PC:
+
+`-min-line-mul'
+     Use an in-line code sequence for integer multiplies.  This is the
+     default.
+
+`-mcall-lib-mul'
+     Call `lmul$$' for integer multiples.
+
+`-mfull-fp-blocks'
+     Generate full-size floating point data blocks, including the
+     minimum amount of scratch space recommended by IBM.  This is the
+     default.
+
+`-mminimum-fp-blocks'
+     Do not include extra scratch space in floating point data blocks.
+     This results in smaller code, but slower execution, since scratch
+     space must be allocated dynamically.
+
+`-mfp-arg-in-fpregs'
+     Use a calling sequence incompatible with the IBM calling
+     convention in which floating point arguments are passed in
+     floating point registers.  Note that `varargs.h' and `stdargs.h'
+     will not work with floating point operands if this option is
+     specified.
+
+`-mfp-arg-in-gregs'
+     Use the normal calling convention for floating point arguments.
+     This is the default.
+
+`-mhc-struct-return'
+     Return structures of more than one word in memory, rather than in a
+     register.  This provides compatibility with the MetaWare HighC (hc)
+     compiler.  Use the option `-fpcc-struct-return' for compatibility
+     with the Portable C Compiler (pcc).
+
+`-mnohc-struct-return'
+     Return some structures of more than one word in registers, when
+     convenient.  This is the default.  For compatibility with the
+     IBM-supplied compilers, use the option `-fpcc-struct-return' or the
+     option `-mhc-struct-return'.

+File: gcc.info,  Node: MIPS Options,  Next: i386 Options,  Prev: RT Options,  Up: Submodel Options
+
+MIPS Options
+------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the MIPS family of computers:
+
+`-mcpu=CPU TYPE'
+     Assume the defaults for the machine type CPU TYPE when scheduling
+     instructions.  The choices for CPU TYPE are `r2000', `r3000',
+     `r3900', `r4000', `r4100', `r4300', `r4400', `r4600', `r4650',
+     `r5000', `r6000', `r8000', and `orion'.  Additionally, the
+     `r2000', `r3000', `r4000', `r5000', and `r6000' can be abbreviated
+     as `r2k' (or `r2K'), `r3k', etc.  While picking a specific CPU
+     TYPE will schedule things appropriately for that particular chip,
+     the compiler will not generate any code that does not meet level 1
+     of the MIPS ISA (instruction set architecture) without a `-mipsX'
+     or `-mabi' switch being used.
+
+`-mips1'
+     Issue instructions from level 1 of the MIPS ISA.  This is the
+     default.  `r3000' is the default CPU TYPE at this ISA level.
+
+`-mips2'
+     Issue instructions from level 2 of the MIPS ISA (branch likely,
+     square root instructions).  `r6000' is the default CPU TYPE at this
+     ISA level.
+
+`-mips3'
+     Issue instructions from level 3 of the MIPS ISA (64 bit
+     instructions).  `r4000' is the default CPU TYPE at this ISA level.
+
+`-mips4'
+     Issue instructions from level 4 of the MIPS ISA (conditional move,
+     prefetch, enhanced FPU instructions).  `r8000' is the default CPU
+     TYPE at this ISA level.
+
+`-mfp32'
+     Assume that 32 32-bit floating point registers are available.
+     This is the default.
+
+`-mfp64'
+     Assume that 32 64-bit floating point registers are available.
+     This is the default when the `-mips3' option is used.
+
+`-mgp32'
+     Assume that 32 32-bit general purpose registers are available.
+     This is the default.
+
+`-mgp64'
+     Assume that 32 64-bit general purpose registers are available.
+     This is the default when the `-mips3' option is used.
+
+`-mint64'
+     Force int and long types to be 64 bits wide.  See `-mlong32' for an
+     explanation of the default, and the width of pointers.
+
+`-mlong64'
+     Force long types to be 64 bits wide.  See `-mlong32' for an
+     explanation of the default, and the width of pointers.
+
+`-mlong32'
+     Force long, int, and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.
+
+     If none of `-mlong32', `-mlong64', or `-mint64' are set, the size
+     of ints, longs, and pointers depends on the ABI and ISA choosen.
+     For `-mabi=32', and `-mabi=n32', ints and longs are 32 bits wide.
+     For `-mabi=64', ints are 32 bits, and longs are 64 bits wide.  For
+     `-mabi=eabi' and either `-mips1' or `-mips2', ints and longs are
+     32 bits wide.  For `-mabi=eabi' and higher ISAs, ints are 32 bits,
+     and longs are 64 bits wide.  The width of pointer types is the
+     smaller of the width of longs or the width of general purpose
+     registers (which in turn depends on the ISA).
+
+`-mabi=32'
+`-mabi=o64'
+`-mabi=n32'
+`-mabi=64'
+`-mabi=eabi'
+     Generate code for the indicated ABI.  The default instruction
+     level is `-mips1' for `32', `-mips3' for `n32', and `-mips4'
+     otherwise.  Conversely, with `-mips1' or `-mips2', the default ABI
+     is `32'; otherwise, the default ABI is `64'.
+
+`-mmips-as'
+     Generate code for the MIPS assembler, and invoke `mips-tfile' to
+     add normal debug information.  This is the default for all
+     platforms except for the OSF/1 reference platform, using the
+     OSF/rose object format.  If the either of the `-gstabs' or
+     `-gstabs+' switches are used, the `mips-tfile' program will
+     encapsulate the stabs within MIPS ECOFF.
+
+`-mgas'
+     Generate code for the GNU assembler.  This is the default on the
+     OSF/1 reference platform, using the OSF/rose object format.  Also,
+     this is the default if the configure option `--with-gnu-as' is
+     used.
+
+`-msplit-addresses'
+`-mno-split-addresses'
+     Generate code to load the high and low parts of address constants
+     separately.  This allows `gcc' to optimize away redundant loads of
+     the high order bits of addresses.  This optimization requires GNU
+     as and GNU ld.  This optimization is enabled by default for some
+     embedded targets where GNU as and GNU ld are standard.
+
+`-mrnames'
+`-mno-rnames'
+     The `-mrnames' switch says to output code using the MIPS software
+     names for the registers, instead of the hardware names (ie, A0
+     instead of $4).  The only known assembler that supports this option
+     is the Algorithmics assembler.
+
+`-mgpopt'
+`-mno-gpopt'
+     The `-mgpopt' switch says to write all of the data declarations
+     before the instructions in the text section, this allows the MIPS
+     assembler to generate one word memory references instead of using
+     two words for short global or static data items.  This is on by
+     default if optimization is selected.
+
+`-mstats'
+`-mno-stats'
+     For each non-inline function processed, the `-mstats' switch
+     causes the compiler to emit one line to the standard error file to
+     print statistics about the program (number of registers saved,
+     stack size, etc.).
+
+`-mmemcpy'
+`-mno-memcpy'
+     The `-mmemcpy' switch makes all block moves call the appropriate
+     string function (`memcpy' or `bcopy') instead of possibly
+     generating inline code.
+
+`-mmips-tfile'
+`-mno-mips-tfile'
+     The `-mno-mips-tfile' switch causes the compiler not postprocess
+     the object file with the `mips-tfile' program, after the MIPS
+     assembler has generated it to add debug support.  If `mips-tfile'
+     is not run, then no local variables will be available to the
+     debugger.  In addition, `stage2' and `stage3' objects will have
+     the temporary file names passed to the assembler embedded in the
+     object file, which means the objects will not compare the same.
+     The `-mno-mips-tfile' switch should only be used when there are
+     bugs in the `mips-tfile' program that prevents compilation.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.  Normally
+     the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
+     this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
+     your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
+     cross-compilation.
+
+`-mhard-float'
+     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
+     the default if you use the unmodified sources.
+
+`-mabicalls'
+`-mno-abicalls'
+     Emit (or do not emit) the pseudo operations `.abicalls',
+     `.cpload', and `.cprestore' that some System V.4 ports use for
+     position independent code.
+
+`-mlong-calls'
+`-mno-long-calls'
+     Do all calls with the `JALR' instruction, which requires loading
+     up a function's address into a register before the call.  You need
+     to use this switch, if you call outside of the current 512
+     megabyte segment to functions that are not through pointers.
+
+`-mhalf-pic'
+`-mno-half-pic'
+     Put pointers to extern references into the data section and load
+     them up, rather than put the references in the text section.
+
+`-membedded-pic'
+`-mno-embedded-pic'
+     Generate PIC code suitable for some embedded systems.  All calls
+     are made using PC relative address, and all data is addressed
+     using the $gp register.  No more than 65536 bytes of global data
+     may be used.  This requires GNU as and GNU ld which do most of the
+     work.  This currently only works on targets which use ECOFF; it
+     does not work with ELF.
+
+`-membedded-data'
+`-mno-embedded-data'
+     Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if
+     possible, then next in the small data section if possible,
+     otherwise in data.  This gives slightly slower code than the
+     default, but reduces the amount of RAM required when executing,
+     and thus may be preferred for some embedded systems.
+
+`-msingle-float'
+`-mdouble-float'
+     The `-msingle-float' switch tells gcc to assume that the floating
+     point coprocessor only supports single precision operations, as on
+     the `r4650' chip.  The `-mdouble-float' switch permits gcc to use
+     double precision operations.  This is the default.
+
+`-mmad'
+`-mno-mad'
+     Permit use of the `mad', `madu' and `mul' instructions, as on the
+     `r4650' chip.
+
+`-m4650'
+     Turns on `-msingle-float', `-mmad', and, at least for now,
+     `-mcpu=r4650'.
+
+`-mips16'
+`-mno-mips16'
+     Enable 16-bit instructions.
+
+`-mentry'
+     Use the entry and exit pseudo ops.  This option can only be used
+     with `-mips16'.
+
+`-EL'
+     Compile code for the processor in little endian mode.  The
+     requisite libraries are assumed to exist.
+
+`-EB'
+     Compile code for the processor in big endian mode.  The requisite
+     libraries are assumed to exist.
+
+`-G NUM'
+     Put global and static items less than or equal to NUM bytes into
+     the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
+     section.  This allows the assembler to emit one word memory
+     reference instructions based on the global pointer (GP or $28),
+     instead of the normal two words used.  By default, NUM is 8 when
+     the MIPS assembler is used, and 0 when the GNU assembler is used.
+     The `-G NUM' switch is also passed to the assembler and linker.
+     All modules should be compiled with the same `-G NUM' value.
+
+`-nocpp'
+     Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over user
+     assembler files (with a `.s' suffix) when assembling them.
+
+   These options are defined by the macro `TARGET_SWITCHES' in the
+machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
+that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

+
+Intel 386 Options
+-----------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the i386 family of computers:
+
+`-mcpu=CPU TYPE'
+     Assume the defaults for the machine type CPU TYPE when scheduling
+     instructions.  The choices for CPU TYPE are:
+
+     `i386'        `i486'        `i586'        `i686'        
+     `pentium'     `pentiumpro'  `k6'                        
+
+     While picking a specific CPU TYPE will schedule things
+     appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler will not
+     generate any code that does not run on the i386 without the
+     `-march=CPU TYPE' option being used.  `i586' is equivalent to
+     `pentium' and `i686' is equivalent to `pentiumpro'.  `k6' is the
+     AMD chip as opposed to the Intel ones.
+
+`-march=CPU TYPE'
+     Generate instructions for the machine type CPU TYPE.  The choices
+     for CPU TYPE are the same as for `-mcpu'.  Moreover, specifying
+     `-march=CPU TYPE' implies `-mcpu=CPU TYPE'.
+
+`-m386'
+`-m486'
+`-mpentium'
+`-mpentiumpro'
+     Synonyms for -mcpu=i386, -mcpu=i486, -mcpu=pentium, and
+     -mcpu=pentiumpro respectively.  These synonyms are deprecated.
+
+`-mieee-fp'
+`-mno-ieee-fp'
+     Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating point
+     comparisons.  These handle correctly the case where the result of a
+     comparison is unordered.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.  Normally
+     the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
+     this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
+     your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
+     cross-compilation.
+
+     On machines where a function returns floating point results in the
+     80387 register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted
+     even if `-msoft-float' is used.
+
+`-mno-fp-ret-in-387'
+     Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.
+
+     The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
+     `float' and `double' in an FPU register, even if there is no FPU.
+     The idea is that the operating system should emulate an FPU.
+
+     The option `-mno-fp-ret-in-387' causes such values to be returned
+     in ordinary CPU registers instead.
+
+`-mno-fancy-math-387'
+     Some 387 emulators do not support the `sin', `cos' and `sqrt'
+     instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid generating
+     those instructions. This option is the default on FreeBSD.  As of
+     revision 2.6.1, these instructions are not generated unless you
+     also use the `-ffast-math' switch.
+
+`-malign-double'
+`-mno-align-double'
+     Control whether GCC aligns `double', `long double', and `long
+     long' variables on a two word boundary or a one word boundary.
+     Aligning `double' variables on a two word boundary will produce
+     code that runs somewhat faster on a `Pentium' at the expense of
+     more memory.
+
+     *Warning:* if you use the `-malign-double' switch, structures
+     containing the above types will be aligned differently than the
+     published application binary interface specifications for the 386.
+
+`-msvr3-shlib'
+`-mno-svr3-shlib'
+     Control whether GCC places uninitialized locals into `bss' or
+     `data'.  `-msvr3-shlib' places these locals into `bss'.  These
+     options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.
+
+`-mno-wide-multiply'
+`-mwide-multiply'
+     Control whether GCC uses the `mul' and `imul' that produce 64 bit
+     results in `eax:edx' from 32 bit operands to do `long long'
+     multiplies and 32-bit division by constants.
+
+`-mrtd'
+     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
+     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the `ret' NUM
+     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
+     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
+     the arguments there.
+
+     You can specify that an individual function is called with this
+     calling sequence with the function attribute `stdcall'.  You can
+     also override the `-mrtd' option by using the function attribute
+     `cdecl'.  *Note Function Attributes::.
+
+     *Warning:* this calling convention is incompatible with the one
+     normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
+     libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.
+
+     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
+     take variable numbers of arguments (including `printf'); otherwise
+     incorrect code will be generated for calls to those functions.
+
+     In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
+     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
+     harmlessly ignored.)
+
+`-mreg-alloc=REGS'
+     Control the default allocation order of integer registers.  The
+     string REGS is a series of letters specifying a register.  The
+     supported letters are: `a' allocate EAX; `b' allocate EBX; `c'
+     allocate ECX; `d' allocate EDX; `S' allocate ESI; `D' allocate
+     EDI; `B' allocate EBP.
+
+`-mregparm=NUM'
+     Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
+     default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
+     registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a
+     specific function by using the function attribute `regparm'.
+     *Note Function Attributes::.
+
+     *Warning:* if you use this switch, and NUM is nonzero, then you
+     must build all modules with the same value, including any
+     libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.
+
+`-malign-loops=NUM'
+     Align loops to a 2 raised to a NUM byte boundary.  If
+     `-malign-loops' is not specified, the default is 2 unless gas 2.8
+     (or later) is being used in which case the default is to align the
+     loop on a 16 byte boundary if it is less than 8 bytes away.
+
+`-malign-jumps=NUM'
+     Align instructions that are only jumped to to a 2 raised to a NUM
+     byte boundary.  If `-malign-jumps' is not specified, the default is
+     2 if optimizing for a 386, and 4 if optimizing for a 486 unless
+     gas 2.8 (or later) is being used in which case the default is to
+     align the instruction on a 16 byte boundary if it is less than 8
+     bytes away.
+
+`-malign-functions=NUM'
+     Align the start of functions to a 2 raised to NUM byte boundary.
+     If `-malign-functions' is not specified, the default is 2 if
+     optimizing for a 386, and 4 if optimizing for a 486.
+
+`-mpreferred-stack-boundary=NUM'
+     Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to NUM
+     byte boundary.  If `-mpreferred-stack-boundary' is not specified,
+     the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).
+
+     The stack is required to be aligned on a 4 byte boundary.  On
+     Pentium and PentiumPro, `double' and `long double' values should be
+     aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see `-malign-double') or suffer
+     significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium III, the
+     Streaming SIMD Extention (SSE) data type `__m128' suffers similar
+     penalties if it is not 16 byte aligned.
+
+     To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack
+     boundary must be as aligned as that required by any value stored
+     on the stack.  Further, every function must be generated such that
+     it keeps the stack aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with
+     a higher preferred stack boundary from a function compiled with a
+     lower preferred stack boundary will most likely misalign the
+     stack.  It is recommended that libraries that use callbacks always
+     use the default setting.
+
+     This extra alignment does consume extra stack space.  Code that is
+     sensitive to stack space usage, such as embedded systems and
+     operating system kernels, may want to reduce the preferred
+     alignment to `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2'.

+
+HPPA Options
+------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:
+
+`-march=ARCHITECTURE TYPE'
+     Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
+     ARCHITECTURE TYPE are `1.0' for PA 1.0, `1.1' for PA 1.1, and
+     `2.0' for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to `/usr/lib/sched.models' on
+     an HP-UX system to determine the proper architecture option for
+     your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered architectures will
+     run on higher numbered architectures, but not the other way around.
+
+     PA 2.0 support currently requires gas snapshot 19990413 or later.
+     The next release of binutils (current is 2.9.1) will probably
+     contain PA 2.0 support.
+
+`-mpa-risc-1-0'
+`-mpa-risc-1-1'
+`-mpa-risc-2-0'
+     Synonyms for -march=1.0, -march=1.1, and -march=2.0 respectively.
+
+`-mbig-switch'
+     Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option
+     only if the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches
+     within a switch table.
+
+`-mjump-in-delay'
+     Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump
+     instructions by modifying the return pointer for the function call
+     to be the target of the conditional jump.
+
+`-mdisable-fpregs'
+     Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.
+     This is necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context
+     switching of floating point registers.  If you use this option and
+     attempt to perform floating point operations, the compiler will
+     abort.
+
+`-mdisable-indexing'
+     Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This
+     avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated
+     code under MACH.
+
+`-mno-space-regs'
+     Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.
+     This allows GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled
+     index address modes.
+
+     Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.
+
+`-mfast-indirect-calls'
+     Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.
+     This allows GCC to emit code which performs faster indirect calls.
+
+     This option will not work in the presense of shared libraries or
+     nested functions.
+
+`-mspace'
+     Optimize for space rather than execution time.  Currently this only
+     enables out of line function prologues and epilogues.  This option
+     is incompatible with PIC code generation and profiling.
+
+`-mlong-load-store'
+     Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes
+     required by the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the `+k'
+     option to the HP compilers.
+
+`-mportable-runtime'
+     Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF
+     systems.
+
+`-mgas'
+     Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.
+
+`-mschedule=CPU TYPE'
+     Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
+     CPU TYPE.  The choices for CPU TYPE are `700' `7100', `7100LC',
+     `7200', and `8000'.  Refer to `/usr/lib/sched.models' on an HP-UX
+     system to determine the proper scheduling option for your machine.
+
+`-mlinker-opt'
+     Enable the optimization pass in the HPUX linker.  Note this makes
+     symbolic debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HPUX
+     8 and HPUX 9 linkers in which they give bogus error messages when
+     linking some programs.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
+     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
+     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
+     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
+     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded
+     target `hppa1.1-*-pro' does provide software floating point
+     support.
+
+     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
+     therefore, it is only useful if you compile *all* of a program with
+     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
+     library that comes with GCC, with `-msoft-float' in order for this
+     to work.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Intel 960 Options,  Next: DEC Alpha Options,  Prev: HPPA Options,  Up: Submodel Options
+
+Intel 960 Options
+-----------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the Intel 960 implementations:
+
+`-mCPU TYPE'
+     Assume the defaults for the machine type CPU TYPE for some of the
+     other options, including instruction scheduling, floating point
+     support, and addressing modes.  The choices for CPU TYPE are `ka',
+     `kb', `mc', `ca', `cf', `sa', and `sb'.  The default is `kb'.
+
+`-mnumerics'
+`-msoft-float'
+     The `-mnumerics' option indicates that the processor does support
+     floating-point instructions.  The `-msoft-float' option indicates
+     that floating-point support should not be assumed.
+
+`-mleaf-procedures'
+`-mno-leaf-procedures'
+     Do (or do not) attempt to alter leaf procedures to be callable
+     with the `bal' instruction as well as `call'.  This will result in
+     more efficient code for explicit calls when the `bal' instruction
+     can be substituted by the assembler or linker, but less efficient
+     code in other cases, such as calls via function pointers, or using
+     a linker that doesn't support this optimization.
+
+`-mtail-call'
+`-mno-tail-call'
+     Do (or do not) make additional attempts (beyond those of the
+     machine-independent portions of the compiler) to optimize
+     tail-recursive calls into branches.  You may not want to do this
+     because the detection of cases where this is not valid is not
+     totally complete.  The default is `-mno-tail-call'.
+
+`-mcomplex-addr'
+`-mno-complex-addr'
+     Assume (or do not assume) that the use of a complex addressing
+     mode is a win on this implementation of the i960.  Complex
+     addressing modes may not be worthwhile on the K-series, but they
+     definitely are on the C-series.  The default is currently
+     `-mcomplex-addr' for all processors except the CB and CC.
+
+`-mcode-align'
+`-mno-code-align'
+     Align code to 8-byte boundaries for faster fetching (or don't
+     bother).  Currently turned on by default for C-series
+     implementations only.
+
+`-mic-compat'
+`-mic2.0-compat'
+`-mic3.0-compat'
+     Enable compatibility with iC960 v2.0 or v3.0.
+
+`-masm-compat'
+`-mintel-asm'
+     Enable compatibility with the iC960 assembler.
+
+`-mstrict-align'
+`-mno-strict-align'
+     Do not permit (do permit) unaligned accesses.
+
+`-mold-align'
+     Enable structure-alignment compatibility with Intel's gcc release
+     version 1.3 (based on gcc 1.37).  This option implies
+     `-mstrict-align'.
+
+`-mlong-double-64'
+     Implement type `long double' as 64-bit floating point numbers.
+     Without the option `long double' is implemented by 80-bit floating
+     point numbers.  The only reason we have it because there is no
+     128-bit `long double' support in `fp-bit.c' yet.  So it is only
+     useful for people using soft-float targets.  Otherwise, we should

+DEC Alpha Options
+-----------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:
+
+`-mno-soft-float'
+`-msoft-float'
+     Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
+     floating-point operations.  When `-msoft-float' is specified,
+     functions in `libgcc1.c' will be used to perform floating-point
+     operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
+     floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call
+     such emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
+     operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without
+     floating-point operations, you must ensure that the library is
+     built so as not to call them.
+
+     Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations
+     are required to have floating-point registers.
+
+`-mfp-reg'
+`-mno-fp-regs'
+     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register
+     set.  `-mno-fp-regs' implies `-msoft-float'.  If the floating-point
+     register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in
+     integer registers as if they were integers and floating-point
+     results are passed in $0 instead of $f0.  This is a non-standard
+     calling sequence, so any function with a floating-point argument
+     or return value called by code compiled with `-mno-fp-regs' must
+     also be compiled with that option.
+
+     A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not
+     use, and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point
+     registers.
+
+`-mieee'
+     The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware
+     optimized for maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with
+     the IEEE floating point standard.  However, for full compliance,
+     software assistance is required.  This option generates code fully
+     IEEE compliant code *except* that the INEXACT FLAG is not
+     maintained (see below).  If this option is turned on, the CPP
+     macro `_IEEE_FP' is defined during compilation.  The option is a
+     shorthand for: `-D_IEEE_FP -mfp-trap-mode=su -mtrap-precision=i
+     -mieee-conformant'.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
+     able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional
+     IEEE values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other
+     Alpha compilers call this option `-ieee_with_no_inexact'.
+
+`-mieee-with-inexact'
+     This is like `-mieee' except the generated code also maintains the
+     IEEE INEXACT FLAG.  Turning on this option causes the generated
+     code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  The option is a
+     shorthand for `-D_IEEE_FP -D_IEEE_FP_INEXACT' plus the three
+     following: `-mieee-conformant', `-mfp-trap-mode=sui', and
+     `-mtrap-precision=i'.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting
+     code may execute significantly slower than the code generated by
+     default.  Since there is very little code that depends on the
+     INEXACT FLAG, you should normally not specify this option.  Other
+     Alpha compilers call this option `-ieee_with_inexact'.
+
+`-mfp-trap-mode=TRAP MODE'
+     This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
+     Other Alpha compilers call this option `-fptm 'TRAP MODE.  The
+     trap mode can be set to one of four values:
+
+    `n'
+          This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that
+          are enabled are the ones that cannot be disabled in software
+          (e.g., division by zero trap).
+
+    `u'
+          In addition to the traps enabled by `n', underflow traps are
+          enabled as well.
+
+    `su'
+          Like `su', but the instructions are marked to be safe for
+          software completion (see Alpha architecture manual for
+          details).
+
+    `sui'
+          Like `su', but inexact traps are enabled as well.
+
+`-mfp-rounding-mode=ROUNDING MODE'
+     Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this
+     option `-fprm 'ROUNDING MODE.  The ROUNDING MODE can be one of:
+
+    `n'
+          Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are
+          rounded towards the nearest machine number or towards the
+          even machine number in case of a tie.
+
+    `m'
+          Round towards minus infinity.
+
+    `c'
+          Chopped rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded
+          towards zero.
+
+    `d'
+          Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating point control
+          register (FPCR, see Alpha architecture reference manual)
+          controls the rounding mode in effect.  The C library
+          initializes this register for rounding towards plus infinity.
+          Thus, unless your program modifies the FPCR, `d' corresponds
+          to round towards plus infinity.
+
+`-mtrap-precision=TRAP PRECISION'
+     In the Alpha architecture, floating point traps are imprecise.
+     This means without software assistance it is impossible to recover
+     from a floating trap and program execution normally needs to be
+     terminated.  GCC can generate code that can assist operating
+     system trap handlers in determining the exact location that caused
+     a floating point trap.  Depending on the requirements of an
+     application, different levels of precisions can be selected:
+
+    `p'
+          Program precision.  This option is the default and means a
+          trap handler can only identify which program caused a
+          floating point exception.
+
+    `f'
+          Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the
+          function that caused a floating point exception.
+
+    `i'
+          Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the
+          exact instruction that caused a floating point exception.
+
+     Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
+     `-scope_safe' and `-resumption_safe'.
+
+`-mieee-conformant'
+     This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must
+     not use this option unless you also specify `-mtrap-precision=i'
+     and either `-mfp-trap-mode=su' or `-mfp-trap-mode=sui'.  Its only
+     effect is to emit the line `.eflag 48' in the function prologue of
+     the generated assembly file.  Under DEC Unix, this has the effect
+     that IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.
+
+`-mbuild-constants'
+     Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to see if
+     it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
+     instructions.  If it cannot, it will output the constant as a
+     literal and generate code to load it from the data segment at
+     runtime.
+
+     Use this option to require GCC to construct *all* integer constants
+     using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is
+     six).
+
+     You would typically use this option to build a shared library
+     dynamic loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself
+     in memory before it can find the variables and constants in its
+     own data segment.
+
+`-malpha-as'
+`-mgas'
+     Select whether to generate code to be assembled by the
+     vendor-supplied assembler (`-malpha-as') or by the GNU assembler
+     `-mgas'.
+
+`-mbwx'
+`-mno-bwx'
+`-mcix'
+`-mno-cix'
+`-mmax'
+`-mno-max'
+     Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX,
+     CIX, and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the
+     instruction sets supported by the CPU type specified via `-mcpu='
+     option or that of the CPU on which GCC was built if none was
+     specified.
+
+`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
+     Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
+     parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  You can specify either the
+     `EV' style name or the corresponding chip number.  GCC supports
+     scheduling parameters for the EV4 and EV5 family of processors and
+     will choose the default values for the instruction set from the
+     processor you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type,
+     GCC will default to the processor on which the compiler was built.
+
+     Supported values for CPU_TYPE are
+
+    `ev4'
+    `21064'
+          Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set extensions.
+
+    `ev5'
+    `21164'
+          Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set extensions.
+
+    `ev56'
+    `21164a'
+          Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.
+
+    `pca56'
+    `21164pc'
+    `21164PC'
+          Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX extensions.
+
+    `ev6'
+    `21264'
+          Schedules as an EV5 (until Digital releases the scheduling
+          parameters for the EV6) and supports the BWX, CIX, and MAX
+          extensions.
+
+`-mmemory-latency=TIME'
+     Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory
+     references as seen by the application.  This number is highly
+     dependant on the memory access patterns used by the application
+     and the size of the external cache on the machine.
+
+     Valid options for TIME are
+
+    `NUMBER'
+          A decimal number representing clock cycles.
+
+    `L1'
+    `L2'
+    `L3'
+    `main'
+          The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock cycles
+          for "typical" EV4 & EV5 hardware for the Level 1, 2 & 3 caches
+          (also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main
+          memory.  Note that L3 is only valid for EV5.

+
+TMS320C3x/C4x Options
+---------------------
+
+   These `-m' options are defined for TMS320C3x/C4x implementations:
+
+`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
+     Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
+     parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  Supported values for
+     CPU_TYPE are `c30', `c31', `c32', `c40', and `c44'.  The default
+     is `c40' to generate code for the TMS320C40.
+
+`-mbig-memory'
+
+`-mbig'
+`-msmall-memory'
+`-msmall'
+     Generates code for the big or small memory model.  The small memory
+     model assumed that all data fits into one 64K word page.  At
+     run-time the data page (DP) register must be set to point to the
+     64K page containing the .bss and .data program sections.  The big
+     memory model is the default and requires reloading of the DP
+     register for every direct memory access.
+
+`-mbk'
+`-mno-bk'
+     Allow (disallow) allocation of general integer operands into the
+     block count register BK.
+
+`-mdb'
+`-mno-db'
+     Enable (disable) generation of code using decrement and branch,
+     DBcond(D), instructions.  This is enabled by default for the C4x.
+     To be on the safe side, this is disabled for the C3x, since the
+     maximum iteration count on the C3x is 2^23 + 1 (but who iterates
+     loops more than 2^23 times on the C3x?).  Note that GCC will try
+     to reverse a loop so that it can utilise the decrement and branch
+     instruction, but will give up if there is more than one memory
+     reference in the loop.  Thus a loop where the loop counter is
+     decremented can generate slightly more efficient code, in cases
+     where the RPTB instruction cannot be utilised.
+
+`-mdp-isr-reload'
+`-mparanoid'
+     Force the DP register to be saved on entry to an interrupt service
+     routine (ISR), reloaded to point to the data section, and restored
+     on exit from the ISR.  This should not be required unless someone
+     has violated the small memory model by modifying the DP register,
+     say within an object library.
+
+`-mmpyi'
+`-mno-mpyi'
+     For the C3x use the 24-bit MPYI instruction for integer multiplies
+     instead of a library call to guarantee 32-bit results.  Note that
+     if one of the operands is a constant, then the multiplication will
+     be performed using shifts and adds.  If the -mmpyi option is not
+     specified for the C3x, then squaring operations are performed
+     inline instead of a library call.
+
+`-mfast-fix'
+`-mno-fast-fix'
+     The C3x/C4x FIX instruction to convert a floating point value to an
+     integer value chooses the nearest integer less than or equal to the
+     floating point value rather than to the nearest integer.  Thus if
+     the floating point number is negative, the result will be
+     incorrectly truncated an additional code is necessary to detect
+     and correct this case.  This option can be used to disable
+     generation of the additional code required to correct the result.
+
+`-mrptb'
+`-mno-rptb'
+     Enable (disable) generation of repeat block sequences using the
+     RPTB instruction for zero overhead looping.  The RPTB construct is
+     only used for innermost loops that do not call functions or jump
+     across the loop boundaries.  There is no advantage having nested
+     RPTB loops due to the overhead required to save and restore the
+     RC, RS, and RE registers.  This is enabled by default with -O2.
+
+`-mrpts=COUNT'
+`-mno-rpts'
+     Enable (disable) the use of the single instruction repeat
+     instruction RPTS.  If a repeat block contains a single
+     instruction, and the loop count can be guaranteed to be less than
+     the value COUNT, GCC will emit a RPTS instruction instead of a
+     RPTB.  If no value is specified, then a RPTS will be emitted even
+     if the loop count cannot be determined at compile time.  Note that
+     the repeated instruction following RPTS does not have to be
+     reloaded from memory each iteration, thus freeing up the CPU buses
+     for oeprands.  However, since interrupts are blocked by this
+     instruction, it is disabled by default.
+
+`-mloop-unsigned'
+`-mno-loop-unsigned'
+     The maximum iteration count when using RPTS and RPTB (and DB on
+     the C40) is 2^31 + 1 since these instructions test if the
+     iteration count is negative to terminate the loop.  If the
+     iteration count is unsigned there is a possibility than the 2^31 +
+     1 maximum iteration count may be exceeded.  This switch allows an
+     unsigned iteration count.
+
+`-mti'
+     Try to emit an assembler syntax that the TI assembler (asm30) is
+     happy with.  This also enforces compatibility with the API
+     employed by the TI C3x C compiler.  For example, long doubles are
+     passed as structures rather than in floating point registers.
+
+`-mregparm'
+`-mmemparm'
+     Generate code that uses registers (stack) for passing arguments to
+     functions.  By default, arguments are passed in registers where
+     possible rather than by pushing arguments on to the stack.
+
+`-mparallel-insns'
+`-mno-parallel-insns'
+     Allow the generation of parallel instructions.  This is enabled by
+     default with -O2.
+
+`-mparallel-mpy'
+`-mno-parallel-mpy'
+     Allow the generation of MPY||ADD and MPY||SUB parallel
+     instructions, provided -mparallel-insns is also specified.  These
+     instructions have tight register constraints which can pessimize
+     the code generation of large functions.

+     Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to

+     up into a register, and call indirect through the pointer.
+
+`-mno-ep'
+`-mep'
+     Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same index
+     pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the `ep' register, and
+     use the shorter `sld' and `sst' instructions.  The `-mep' option
+     is on by default if you optimize.
+
+`-mno-prolog-function'
+`-mprolog-function'
+     Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore
+     registers at the prolog and epilog of a function.  The external
+     functions are slower, but use less code space if more than one
+     function saves the same number of registers.  The

+`-m32032'
+`-m32032'
+     Generate output for a 32032.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 32032 and 32016 based systems.
+
+`-m32332'
+`-m32332'
+     Generate output for a 32332.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 32332-based systems.
+
+`-m32532'
+`-m32532'
+     Generate output for a 32532.  This is the default when the
+     compiler is configured for 32532-based systems.
+
+`-m32081'
+     Generate output containing 32081 instructions for floating point.
+     This is the default for all systems.
+
+`-m32381'
+     Generate output containing 32381 instructions for floating point.
+     This also implies `-m32081'. The 32381 is only compatible with the
+     32332 and 32532 cpus. This is the default for the pc532-netbsd
+     configuration.
+
+`-mmulti-add'
+     Try and generate multiply-add floating point instructions `polyF'
+     and `dotF'. This option is only available if the `-m32381' option
+     is in effect. Using these instructions requires changes to to
+     register allocation which generally has a negative impact on
+     performance.  This option should only be enabled when compiling
+     code particularly likely to make heavy use of multiply-add
+     instructions.
+
+`-mnomulti-add'
+     Do not try and generate multiply-add floating point instructions
+     `polyF' and `dotF'. This is the default on all platforms.
+
+`-msoft-float'
+     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
+     *Warning:* the requisite libraries may not be available.
+
+`-mnobitfield'
+     Do not use the bit-field instructions. On some machines it is
+     faster to use shifting and masking operations. This is the default
+     for the pc532.
+
+`-mbitfield'
+     Do use the bit-field instructions. This is the default for all
+     platforms except the pc532.
+
+`-mrtd'
+     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
+     that take a fixed number of arguments return pop their arguments
+     on return with the `ret' instruction.
+
+     This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used
+     on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
+     compiled with the Unix compiler.
+
+     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
+     take variable numbers of arguments (including `printf'); otherwise
+     incorrect code will be generated for calls to those functions.
+
+     In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
+     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
+     harmlessly ignored.)
+
+     This option takes its name from the 680x0 `rtd' instruction.
+
+`-mregparam'
+     Use a different function-calling convention where the first two
+     arguments are passed in registers.
+
+     This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used
+     on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
+     compiled with the Unix compiler.
+
+`-mnoregparam'
+     Do not pass any arguments in registers. This is the default for all
+     targets.
+
+`-msb'
+     It is OK to use the sb as an index register which is always loaded
+     with zero. This is the default for the pc532-netbsd target.
+
+`-mnosb'
+     The sb register is not available for use or has not been
+     initialized to zero by the run time system. This is the default
+     for all targets except the pc532-netbsd. It is also implied
+     whenever `-mhimem' or `-fpic' is set.
+
+`-mhimem'
+     Many ns32000 series addressing modes use displacements of up to
+     512MB.  If an address is above 512MB then displacements from zero
+     can not be used.  This option causes code to be generated which
+     can be loaded above 512MB.  This may be useful for operating
+     systems or ROM code.
+
+`-mnohimem'
+     Assume code will be loaded in the first 512MB of virtual address
+     space.  This is the default for all platforms.

+
+Options for Code Generation Conventions
+=======================================
+
+   These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
+used in code generation.
+
+   Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
+of `-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the
+forms is listed--the one which is not the default.  You can figure out
+the other form by either removing `no-' or adding it.
+
+`-fexceptions'
+     Enable exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate
+     exceptions.  For some targets, this implies generation of frame
+     unwind information for all functions. This can produce significant
+     data size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you
+     do not specify this option, it is enabled by default for languages
+     like C++ which normally require exception handling, and disabled
+     for languages like C that do not normally require it.  However,
+     when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with
+     exception handlers written in C++, you may need to enable this
+     option.  You may also wish to disable this option is you are
+     compiling older C++ programs that don't use exception handling.
+
+`-fpcc-struct-return'
+     Return "short" `struct' and `union' values in memory like longer
+     ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
+     efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability
+     between GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers.
+
+     The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
+     on the target configuration macros.
+
+     Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment
+     match that of some integer type.
+
+`-freg-struct-return'
+     Use the convention that `struct' and `union' values are returned
+     in registers when possible.  This is more efficient for small
+     structures than `-fpcc-struct-return'.
+
+     If you specify neither `-fpcc-struct-return' nor its contrary
+     `-freg-struct-return', GCC defaults to whichever convention is
+     standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
+     defaults to `-fpcc-struct-return', except on targets where GCC is
+     the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the
+     standard, and we chose the more efficient register return
+     alternative.
+
+`-fshort-enums'
+     Allocate to an `enum' type only as many bytes as it needs for the
+     declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the `enum' type
+     will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough
+     room.
+
+`-fshort-double'
+     Use the same size for `double' as for `float'.
+
+`-fshared-data'
+     Requests that the data and non-`const' variables of this
+     compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The
+     distinction makes sense only on certain operating systems, where
+     shared data is shared between processes running the same program,
+     while private data exists in one copy per process.
+
+`-fno-common'
+     Allocate even uninitialized global variables in the bss section of
+     the object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.
+     This has the effect that if the same variable is declared (without
+     `extern') in two different compilations, you will get an error
+     when you link them.  The only reason this might be useful is if
+     you wish to verify that the program will work on other systems
+     which always work this way.
+
+`-fno-ident'
+     Ignore the `#ident' directive.
+
+`-fno-gnu-linker'
+     Do not output global initializations (such as C++ constructors and
+     destructors) in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where
+     the GNU linker is the standard method of handling them).  Use this
+     option when you want to use a non-GNU linker, which also requires
+     using the `collect2' program to make sure the system linker
+     includes constructors and destructors.  (`collect2' is included in
+     the GCC distribution.)  For systems which *must* use `collect2',
+     the compiler driver `gcc' is configured to do this automatically.
+
+`-finhibit-size-directive'
+     Don't output a `.size' assembler directive, or anything else that
+     would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
+     two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This
+     option is used when compiling `crtstuff.c'; you should not need to
+     use it for anything else.
+
+`-fverbose-asm'
+     Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
+     make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to
+     those who actually need to read the generated assembly code
+     (perhaps while debugging the compiler itself).
+
+     `-fno-verbose-asm', the default, causes the extra information to
+     be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler files.
+
+`-fvolatile'
+     Consider all memory references through pointers to be volatile.
+
+`-fvolatile-global'
+     Consider all memory references to extern and global data items to
+     be volatile.  GCC does not consider static data items to be
+     volatile because of this switch.
+
+`-fvolatile-static'
+     Consider all memory references to static data to be volatile.
+
+`-fpic'
+     Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a
+     shared library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code
+     accesses all constant addresses through a global offset table
+     (GOT).  The dynamic loader resolves the GOT entries when the
+     program starts (the dynamic loader is not part of GCC; it is part
+     of the operating system).  If the GOT size for the linked
+     executable exceeds a machine-specific maximum size, you get an
+     error message from the linker indicating that `-fpic' does not
+     work; in that case, recompile with `-fPIC' instead.  (These
+     maximums are 16k on the m88k, 8k on the Sparc, and 32k on the m68k
+     and RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)
+
+     Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore
+     works only on certain machines.  For the 386, GCC supports PIC for
+     System V but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM
+     RS/6000 is always position-independent.
+
+`-fPIC'
+     If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent
+     code, suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the
+     size of the global offset table.  This option makes a difference
+     on the m68k, m88k, and the Sparc.
+
+     Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore
+     works only on certain machines.
+
+`-ffixed-REG'
+     Treat the register named REG as a fixed register; generated code
+     should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
+     pointer or in some other fixed role).
+
+     REG must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
+     are machine-specific and are defined in the `REGISTER_NAMES' macro
+     in the machine description macro file.
+
+     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
+     three-way choice.
+
+`-fcall-used-REG'
+     Treat the register named REG as an allocable register that is
+     clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries
+     or variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled
+     this way will not save and restore the register REG.
+
+     It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack
+     pointer.  Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed
+     pervasive roles in the machine's execution model will produce
+     disastrous results.
+
+     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
+     three-way choice.
+
+`-fcall-saved-REG'
+     Treat the register named REG as an allocable register saved by
+     functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables
+     that live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save
+     and restore the register REG if they use it.
+
+     It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack
+     pointer.  Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed
+     pervasive roles in the machine's execution model will produce
+     disastrous results.
+
+     A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag
+     for a register in which function values may be returned.
+
+     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
+     three-way choice.
+
+`-fpack-struct'
+     Pack all structure members together without holes.  Usually you
+     would not want to use this option, since it makes the code
+     suboptimal, and the offsets of structure members won't agree with
+     system libraries.
+
+`-fcheck-memory-usage'
+     Generate extra code to check each memory access.  GCC will generate
+     code that is suitable for a detector of bad memory accesses such as
+     `Checker'.
+
+     Normally, you should compile all, or none, of your code with this
+     option.
+
+     If you do mix code compiled with and without this option, you must
+     ensure that all code that has side effects and that is called by
+     code compiled with this option is, itself, compiled with this
+     option.  If you do not, you might get erroneous messages from the
+     detector.
+
+     If you use functions from a library that have side-effects (such as
+     `read'), you might not be able to recompile the library and
+     specify this option.  In that case, you can enable the
+     `-fprefix-function-name' option, which requests GCC to encapsulate
+     your code and make other functions look as if they were compiled
+     with `-fcheck-memory-usage'.  This is done by calling "stubs",
+     which are provided by the detector.  If you cannot find or build
+     stubs for every function you call, you might have to specify
+     `-fcheck-memory-usage' without `-fprefix-function-name'.
+
+     If you specify this option, you can not use the `asm' or `__asm__'
+     keywords in functions with memory checking enabled.  The compiler
+     cannot understand what the `asm' statement will do, and therefore
+     cannot generate the appropriate code, so it is rejected.  However,
+     the function attribute `no_check_memory_usage' will disable memory
+     checking within a function, and `asm' statements can be put inside
+     such functions.  Inline expansion of a non-checked function within
+     a checked function is permitted; the inline function's memory
+     accesses won't be checked, but the rest will.
+
+     If you move your `asm' statements to non-checked inline functions,
+     but they do access memory, you can add calls to the support code
+     in your inline function, to indicate any reads, writes, or copies
+     being done.  These calls would be similar to those done in the
+     stubs described above.
+
+`-fprefix-function-name'
+     Request GCC to add a prefix to the symbols generated for function
+     names.  GCC adds a prefix to the names of functions defined as
+     well as functions called.  Code compiled with this option and code
+     compiled without the option can't be linked together, unless stubs
+     are used.
+
+     If you compile the following code with `-fprefix-function-name'
+          extern void bar (int);
+          void
+          foo (int a)
+          {
+            return bar (a + 5);
+          }
+
+     GCC will compile the code as if it was written:
+          extern void prefix_bar (int);
+          void
+          prefix_foo (int a)
+          {
+            return prefix_bar (a + 5);
+          }
+     This option is designed to be used with `-fcheck-memory-usage'.
+
+`-finstrument-functions'
+     Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.
+     Just after function entry and just before function exit, the
+     following profiling functions will be called with the address of
+     the current function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
+     `__builtin_return_address' does not work beyond the current
+     function, so the call site information may not be available to the
+     profiling functions otherwise.)
+
+          void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn, void *call_site);
+          void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn, void *call_site);
+
+     The first argument is the address of the start of the current
+     function, which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
+
+     This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in
+     other functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where,
+     conceptually, the inline function is entered and exited.  This
+     means that addressable versions of such functions must be
+     available.  If all your uses of a function are expanded inline,
+     this may mean an additional expansion of code size.  If you use
+     `extern inline' in your C code, an addressable version of such
+     functions must be provided.  (This is normally the case anyways,
+     but if you get lucky and the optimizer always expands the
+     functions inline, you might have gotten away without providing
+     static copies.)
+
+     A function may be given the attribute `no_instrument_function', in
+     which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be
+     used, for example, for the profiling functions listed above,
+     high-priority interrupt routines, and any functions from which the
+     profiling functions cannot safely be called (perhaps signal
+     handlers, if the profiling routines generate output or allocate
+     memory).
+
+`-fstack-check'
+     Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of
+     the stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
+     environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify
+     it in a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is
+     automatically detected on nearly all systems if there is only one
+     stack.
+
+`-fargument-alias'
+`-fargument-noalias'
+`-fargument-noalias-global'
+     Specify the possible relationships among parameters and between
+     parameters and global data.
+
+     `-fargument-alias' specifies that arguments (parameters) may alias
+     each other and may alias global storage.  `-fargument-noalias'
+     specifies that arguments do not alias each other, but may alias
+     global storage.  `-fargument-noalias-global' specifies that
+     arguments do not alias each other and do not alias global storage.
+
+     Each language will automatically use whatever option is required by
+     the language standard.  You should not need to use these options
+     yourself.
+
+`-fleading-underscore'
+     This option and its counterpart, -fno-leading-underscore, forcibly
+     change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One
+     use is to help link with legacy assembly code.
+
+     Be warned that you should know what you are doing when invoking
+     this option, and that not all targets provide complete support for
+     it.

+
+Environment Variables Affecting GCC
+===================================
+
+   This section describes several environment variables that affect how
+GCC operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes
+to use when searching for various kinds of files. Some are used to
+specify other aspects of the compilation environment.
+
+   Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
+`-B', `-I' and `-L' (*note Directory Options::.).  These take
+precedence over places specified using environment variables, which in
+turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC.
+*Note Driver::.
+
+`LANG'
+`LC_CTYPE'
+`LC_MESSAGES'
+`LC_ALL'
+     These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
+     localization information that allow GCC to work with different
+     national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
+     `LC_CTYPE' and `LC_MESSAGES' if it has been configured to do so.
+     These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
+     installation.  A typical value is `en_UK' for English in the United
+     Kingdom.
+
+     The `LC_CTYPE' environment variable specifies character
+     classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries
+     in a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that
+     contain quote and escape characters that would otherwise be
+     interpreted as a string end or escape.
+
+     The `LC_MESSAGES' environment variable specifies the language to
+     use in diagnostic messages.
+
+     If the `LC_ALL' environment variable is set, it overrides the value
+     of `LC_CTYPE' and `LC_MESSAGES'; otherwise, `LC_CTYPE' and
+     `LC_MESSAGES' default to the value of the `LANG' environment
+     variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC defaults to
+     traditional C English behavior.
+
+`TMPDIR'
+     If `TMPDIR' is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
+     files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
+     compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for
+     example, the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the
+     compiler proper.
+
+`GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'
+     If `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
+     names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is
+     added when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram,
+     but you can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
+
+     If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
+     tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
+
+     The default value of `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' is `PREFIX/lib/gcc-lib/'
+     where PREFIX is the value of `prefix' when you ran the `configure'
+     script.
+
+     Other prefixes specified with `-B' take precedence over this
+     prefix.
+
+     This prefix is also used for finding files such as `crt0.o' that
+     are used for linking.
+
+     In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
+     directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
+     directories whose name normally begins with
+     `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib' (more precisely, with the value of
+     `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR'), GCC tries replacing that beginning with the
+     specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.  Thus,
+     with `-Bfoo/', GCC will search `foo/bar' where it would normally
+     search `/usr/local/lib/bar'.  These alternate directories are
+     searched first; the standard directories come next.
+
+`COMPILER_PATH'
+     The value of `COMPILER_PATH' is a colon-separated list of
+     directories, much like `PATH'.  GCC tries the directories thus
+     specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
+     subprograms using `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.
+
+`LIBRARY_PATH'
+     The value of `LIBRARY_PATH' is a colon-separated list of
+     directories, much like `PATH'.  When configured as a native
+     compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching
+     for special linker files, if it can't find them using
+     `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  Linking using GCC also uses these directories
+     when searching for ordinary libraries for the `-l' option (but
+     directories specified with `-L' come first).
+
+`C_INCLUDE_PATH'
+`CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH'
+`OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH'
+     These environment variables pertain to particular languages.  Each
+     variable's value is a colon-separated list of directories, much
+     like `PATH'.  When GCC searches for header files, it tries the
+     directories listed in the variable for the language you are using,
+     after the directories specified with `-I' but before the standard
+     header file directories.
+
+`DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT'
+     If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
+     dependencies for Make based on the header files processed by the
+     compiler.  This output looks much like the output from the `-M'
+     option (*note Preprocessor Options::.), but it goes to a separate
+     file, and is in addition to the usual results of compilation.
+
+     The value of `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' can be just a file name, in
+     which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the
+     target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the
+     form `FILE TARGET', in which case the rules are written to file
+     FILE using TARGET as the target name.
+
+`LANG'
+     This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.
+     One way in which this information is used is to determine the
+     character set to be used when character literals, string literals
+     and comments are parsed in C and C++.  When the compiler is
+     configured to allow multibyte characters, the following values for
+     `LANG' are recognized:
+
+    `C-JIS'
+          Recognize JIS characters.
+
+    `C-SJIS'
+          Recognize SJIS characters.
+
+    `C-EUCJP'
+          Recognize EUCJP characters.
+
+     If `LANG' is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
+     compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default
+     locale to recognize and translate multibyte characters.

+
+Running Protoize
+================
+
+   The program `protoize' is an optional part of GNU C.  You can use it
+to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the program to ANSI C
+in one respect.  The companion program `unprotoize' does the reverse:
+it removes argument types from any prototypes that are found.
+
+   When you run these programs, you must specify a set of source files
+as command line arguments.  The conversion programs start out by
+compiling these files to see what functions they define.  The
+information gathered about a file FOO is saved in a file named `FOO.X'.
+
+   After scanning comes actual conversion.  The specified files are all
+eligible to be converted; any files they include (whether sources or
+just headers) are eligible as well.
+
+   But not all the eligible files are converted.  By default,
+`protoize' and `unprotoize' convert only source and header files in the
+current directory.  You can specify additional directories whose files
+should be converted with the `-d DIRECTORY' option.  You can also
+specify particular files to exclude with the `-x FILE' option.  A file
+is converted if it is eligible, its directory name matches one of the
+specified directory names, and its name within the directory has not
+been excluded.
+
+   Basic conversion with `protoize' consists of rewriting most function
+definitions and function declarations to specify the types of the
+arguments.  The only ones not rewritten are those for varargs functions.
+
+   `protoize' optionally inserts prototype declarations at the
+beginning of the source file, to make them available for any calls that
+precede the function's definition.  Or it can insert prototype
+declarations with block scope in the blocks where undeclared functions
+are called.
+
+   Basic conversion with `unprotoize' consists of rewriting most
+function declarations to remove any argument types, and rewriting
+function definitions to the old-style pre-ANSI form.
+
+   Both conversion programs print a warning for any function
+declaration or definition that they can't convert.  You can suppress
+these warnings with `-q'.
+
+   The output from `protoize' or `unprotoize' replaces the original
+source file.  The original file is renamed to a name ending with
+`.save'.  If the `.save' file already exists, then the source file is
+simply discarded.
+
+   `protoize' and `unprotoize' both depend on GCC itself to scan the
+program and collect information about the functions it uses.  So
+neither of these programs will work until GCC is installed.
+
+   Here is a table of the options you can use with `protoize' and
+`unprotoize'.  Each option works with both programs unless otherwise
+stated.
+
+`-B DIRECTORY'
+     Look for the file `SYSCALLS.c.X' in DIRECTORY, instead of the
+     usual directory (normally `/usr/local/lib').  This file contains
+     prototype information about standard system functions.  This option
+     applies only to `protoize'.
+
+`-c COMPILATION-OPTIONS'
+     Use  COMPILATION-OPTIONS as the options when running `gcc' to
+     produce the `.X' files.  The special option `-aux-info' is always
+     passed in addition, to tell `gcc' to write a `.X' file.
+
+     Note that the compilation options must be given as a single
+     argument to `protoize' or `unprotoize'.  If you want to specify
+     several `gcc' options, you must quote the entire set of
+     compilation options to make them a single word in the shell.
+
+     There are certain `gcc' arguments that you cannot use, because they
+     would produce the wrong kind of output.  These include `-g', `-O',
+     `-c', `-S', and `-o' If you include these in the
+     COMPILATION-OPTIONS, they are ignored.
+
+`-C'
+     Rename files to end in `.C' instead of `.c'.  This is convenient
+     if you are converting a C program to C++.  This option applies
+     only to `protoize'.
+
+`-g'
+     Add explicit global declarations.  This means inserting explicit
+     declarations at the beginning of each source file for each function
+     that is called in the file and was not declared.  These
+     declarations precede the first function definition that contains a
+     call to an undeclared function.  This option applies only to
+     `protoize'.
+
+`-i STRING'
+     Indent old-style parameter declarations with the string STRING.
+     This option applies only to `protoize'.
+
+     `unprotoize' converts prototyped function definitions to old-style
+     function definitions, where the arguments are declared between the
+     argument list and the initial `{'.  By default, `unprotoize' uses
+     five spaces as the indentation.  If you want to indent with just
+     one space instead, use `-i " "'.
+
+`-k'
+     Keep the `.X' files.  Normally, they are deleted after conversion
+     is finished.
+
+`-l'
+     Add explicit local declarations.  `protoize' with `-l' inserts a
+     prototype declaration for each function in each block which calls
+     the function without any declaration.  This option applies only to
+     `protoize'.
+
+`-n'
+     Make no real changes.  This mode just prints information about the
+     conversions that would have been done without `-n'.
+
+`-N'
+     Make no `.save' files.  The original files are simply deleted.
+     Use this option with caution.
+
+`-p PROGRAM'
+     Use the program PROGRAM as the compiler.  Normally, the name `gcc'
+     is used.
+
+`-q'
+     Work quietly.  Most warnings are suppressed.
+
+`-v'
+     Print the version number, just like `-v' for `gcc'.
+
+   If you need special compiler options to compile one of your program's
+source files, then you should generate that file's `.X' file specially,
+by running `gcc' on that source file with the appropriate options and
+the option `-aux-info'.  Then run `protoize' on the entire set of
+files.  `protoize' will use the existing `.X' file because it is newer
+than the source file.  For example:
+
+     gcc -Dfoo=bar file1.c -aux-info
+     protoize *.c
+
+You need to include the special files along with the rest in the
+`protoize' command, even though their `.X' files already exist, because
+otherwise they won't get converted.
+
+   *Note Protoize Caveats::, for more information on how to use
+`protoize' successfully.
+
+   Note most of this information is out of date and superceded by the
+EGCS install procedures.  It is provided for historical reference only.

+Installing GNU CC
+*****************
+
+* Menu:
+
+* Configuration Files::  Files created by running `configure'.
+* Configurations::    Configurations Supported by GNU CC.
+* Other Dir::     Compiling in a separate directory (not where the source is).
+* Cross-Compiler::   Building and installing a cross-compiler.
+* Sun Install::   See below for installation on the Sun.
+* VMS Install::   See below for installation on VMS.
+* Collect2::	  How `collect2' works; how it finds `ld'.
+* Header Dirs::   Understanding the standard header file directories.
+
+   Here is the procedure for installing GNU CC on a GNU or Unix system.
+See *Note VMS Install::, for VMS systems.  In this section we assume you
+compile in the same directory that contains the source files; see *Note
+Other Dir::, to find out how to compile in a separate directory on Unix
+systems.
+
+   You cannot install GNU C by itself on MSDOS; it will not compile
+under any MSDOS compiler except itself.  You need to get the complete
+compilation package DJGPP, which includes binaries as well as sources,
+and includes all the necessary compilation tools and libraries.
+
+  1. If you have built GNU CC previously in the same directory for a
+     different target machine, do `make distclean' to delete all files
+     that might be invalid.  One of the files this deletes is
+     `Makefile'; if `make distclean' complains that `Makefile' does not
+     exist, it probably means that the directory is already suitably
+     clean.
+
+  2. On a System V release 4 system, make sure `/usr/bin' precedes
+     `/usr/ucb' in `PATH'.  The `cc' command in `/usr/ucb' uses
+     libraries which have bugs.
+
+  3. Make sure the Bison parser generator is installed.  (This is
+     unnecessary if the Bison output files `c-parse.c' and `cexp.c' are
+     more recent than `c-parse.y' and `cexp.y' and you do not plan to
+     change the `.y' files.)
+
+     Bison versions older than Sept 8, 1988 will produce incorrect
+     output for `c-parse.c'.
+
+  4. If you have chosen a configuration for GNU CC which requires other
+     GNU tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard
+     system tools, install the required tools in the build directory
+     under the names `as', `ld' or whatever is appropriate.  This will
+     enable the compiler to find the proper tools for compilation of
+     the program `enquire'.
+
+     Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of
+     the `PATH' environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools
+     come before the standard system tools.
+
+  5. Specify the host, build and target machine configurations.  You do
+     this when you run the `configure' script.
+
+     The "build" machine is the system which you are using, the "host"
+     machine is the system where you want to run the resulting compiler
+     (normally the build machine), and the "target" machine is the
+     system for which you want the compiler to generate code.
+
+     If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it
+     runs on (a native compiler), you normally do not need to specify
+     any operands to `configure'; it will try to guess the type of
+     machine you are on and use that as the build, host and target
+     machines.  So you don't need to specify a configuration when
+     building a native compiler unless `configure' cannot figure out
+     what your configuration is or guesses wrong.
+
+     In those cases, specify the build machine's "configuration name"
+     with the `--host' option; the host and target will default to be
+     the same as the host machine.  (If you are building a
+     cross-compiler, see *Note Cross-Compiler::.)
+
+     Here is an example:
+
+          ./configure --host=sparc-sun-sunos4.1
+
+     A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
+     abbreviated.
+
+     A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by
+     dashes.  It looks like this: `CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM'.  (The three
+     parts may themselves contain dashes; `configure' can figure out
+     which dashes serve which purpose.)  For example,
+     `m68k-sun-sunos4.1' specifies a Sun 3.
+
+     You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or
+     aliases.  For example, `sun3' stands for `m68k-sun', so
+     `sun3-sunos4.1' is another way to specify a Sun 3.  You can also
+     use simply `sun3-sunos', since the version of SunOS is assumed by
+     default to be version 4.
+
+     You can specify a version number after any of the system types,
+     and some of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is
+     irrelevant, and will be ignored.  So you might as well specify the
+     version if you know it.
+
+     See *Note Configurations::, for a list of supported configuration
+     names and notes on many of the configurations.  You should check
+     the notes in that section before proceeding any further with the
+     installation of GNU CC.
+
+  6. When running `configure', you may also need to specify certain
+     additional options that describe variant hardware and software
+     configurations.  These are `--with-gnu-as', `--with-gnu-ld',
+     `--with-stabs' and `--nfp'.
+
+    `--with-gnu-as'
+          If you will use GNU CC with the GNU assembler (GAS), you
+          should declare this by using the `--with-gnu-as' option when
+          you run `configure'.
+
+          Using this option does not install GAS.  It only modifies the
+          output of GNU CC to work with GAS.  Building and installing
+          GAS is up to you.
+
+          Conversely, if you *do not* wish to use GAS and do not specify
+          `--with-gnu-as' when building GNU CC, it is up to you to make
+          sure that GAS is not installed.  GNU CC searches for a
+          program named `as' in various directories; if the program it
+          finds is GAS, then it runs GAS.  If you are not sure where
+          GNU CC finds the assembler it is using, try specifying `-v'
+          when you run it.
+
+          The systems where it makes a difference whether you use GAS
+          are
+          `hppa1.0-ANY-ANY', `hppa1.1-ANY-ANY', `i386-ANY-sysv',
+          `i386-ANY-isc',
+          `i860-ANY-bsd', `m68k-bull-sysv',
+          `m68k-hp-hpux', `m68k-sony-bsd',
+          `m68k-altos-sysv', `m68000-hp-hpux',
+          `m68000-att-sysv', `ANY-lynx-lynxos', and `mips-ANY').  On
+          any other system, `--with-gnu-as' has no effect.
+
+          On the systems listed above (except for the HP-PA, for ISC on
+          the 386, and for `mips-sgi-irix5.*'), if you use GAS, you
+          should also use the GNU linker (and specify `--with-gnu-ld').
+
+    `--with-gnu-ld'
+          Specify the option `--with-gnu-ld' if you plan to use the GNU
+          linker with GNU CC.
+
+          This option does not cause the GNU linker to be installed; it
+          just modifies the behavior of GNU CC to work with the GNU
+          linker.
+
+    `--with-stabs'
+          On MIPS based systems and on Alphas, you must specify whether
+          you want GNU CC to create the normal ECOFF debugging format,
+          or to use BSD-style stabs passed through the ECOFF symbol
+          table.  The normal ECOFF debug format cannot fully handle
+          languages other than C.  BSD stabs format can handle other
+          languages, but it only works with the GNU debugger GDB.
+
+          Normally, GNU CC uses the ECOFF debugging format by default;
+          if you prefer BSD stabs, specify `--with-stabs' when you
+          configure GNU CC.
+
+          No matter which default you choose when you configure GNU CC,
+          the user can use the `-gcoff' and `-gstabs+' options to
+          specify explicitly the debug format for a particular
+          compilation.
+
+          `--with-stabs' is meaningful on the ISC system on the 386,
+          also, if `--with-gas' is used.  It selects use of stabs
+          debugging information embedded in COFF output.  This kind of
+          debugging information supports C++ well; ordinary COFF
+          debugging information does not.
+
+          `--with-stabs' is also meaningful on 386 systems running
+          SVR4.  It selects use of stabs debugging information embedded
+          in ELF output.  The C++ compiler currently (2.6.0) does not
+          support the DWARF debugging information normally used on 386
+          SVR4 platforms; stabs provide a workable alternative.  This
+          requires gas and gdb, as the normal SVR4 tools can not
+          generate or interpret stabs.
+
+    `--nfp'
+          On certain systems, you must specify whether the machine has
+          a floating point unit.  These systems include
+          `m68k-sun-sunosN' and `m68k-isi-bsd'.  On any other system,
+          `--nfp' currently has no effect, though perhaps there are
+          other systems where it could usefully make a difference.
+
+    `--enable-haifa'
+    `--disable-haifa'
+          Use `--enable-haifa' to enable use of an experimental
+          instruction scheduler (from IBM Haifa).  This may or may not
+          produce better code.  Some targets on which it is known to be
+          a win enable it by default; use `--disable-haifa' to disable
+          it in these cases.  `configure' will print out whether the
+          Haifa scheduler is enabled when it is run.
+
+    `--enable-threads=TYPE'
+          Certain systems, notably Linux-based GNU systems, can't be
+          relied on to supply a threads facility for the Objective C
+          runtime and so will default to single-threaded runtime.  They
+          may, however, have a library threads implementation
+          available, in which case threads can be enabled with this
+          option by supplying a suitable TYPE, probably `posix'.  The
+          possibilities for TYPE are `single', `posix', `win32',
+          `solaris', `irix' and `mach'.
+
+    `--enable-checking'
+          When you specify this option, the compiler is built to
+          perform checking of tree node types when referencing fields
+          of that node.  This does not change the generated code, but
+          adds error checking within the compiler.  This will slow down
+          the compiler and may only work properly if you are building
+          the compiler with GNU C.
+
+          The `configure' script searches subdirectories of the source
+          directory for other compilers that are to be integrated into
+          GNU CC.  The GNU compiler for C++, called G++ is in a
+          subdirectory named `cp'.  `configure' inserts rules into
+          `Makefile' to build all of those compilers.
+
+          Here we spell out what files will be set up by `configure'.
+          Normally you need not be concerned with these files.
+
+             * A file named `config.h' is created that contains a
+               `#include' of the top-level config file for the machine
+               you will run the compiler on (*note Config::.).  This
+               file is responsible for defining information about the
+               host machine.  It includes `tm.h'.
+
+               The top-level config file is located in the subdirectory
+               `config'.  Its name is always `xm-SOMETHING.h'; usually
+               `xm-MACHINE.h', but there are some exceptions.
+
+               If your system does not support symbolic links, you
+               might want to set up `config.h' to contain a `#include'
+               command which refers to the appropriate file.
+
+             * A file named `tconfig.h' is created which includes the
+               top-level config file for your target machine.  This is
+               used for compiling certain programs to run on that
+               machine.
+
+             * A file named `tm.h' is created which includes the
+               machine-description macro file for your target machine.
+               It should be in the subdirectory `config' and its name
+               is often `MACHINE.h'.
+
+    `--enable-nls'
+    `--disable-nls'
+          The `--enable-nls' option enables Native Language Support
+          (NLS), which lets GCC output diagnostics in languages other
+          than American English.  No translations are available yet, so
+          the main users of this option now are those translating GCC's
+          diagnostics who want to test their work.  Once translations
+          become available, Native Language Support will become enabled
+          by default.  The `--disable-nls' option disables NLS.
+
+    `--with-included-gettext'
+          If NLS is enabled, the GCC build procedure normally attempts
+          to use the host's `gettext' libraries, and falls back on
+          GCC's copy of the GNU `gettext' library only if the host
+          libraries do not suffice.  The `--with-included-gettext'
+          option causes the build procedure to prefer its copy of GNU
+          `gettext'.
+
+    `--with-catgets'
+          If NLS is enabled, and if the host lacks `gettext' but has the
+          inferior `catgets' interface, the GCC build procedure normally
+          ignores `catgets' and instead uses GCC's copy of the GNU
+          `gettext' library.  The `--with-catgets' option causes the
+          build procedure to use the host's `catgets' in this situation.
+
+  7. In certain cases, you should specify certain other options when
+     you run `configure'.
+
+        * The standard directory for installing GNU CC is
+          `/usr/local/lib'.  If you want to install its files somewhere
+          else, specify `--prefix=DIR' when you run `configure'.  Here
+          DIR is a directory name to use instead of `/usr/local' for
+          all purposes with one exception: the directory
+          `/usr/local/include' is searched for header files no matter
+          where you install the compiler.  To override this name, use
+          the `--with-local-prefix' option below.  The directory you
+          specify need not exist, but its parent directory must exist.
+
+        * Specify `--with-local-prefix=DIR' if you want the compiler to
+          search directory `DIR/include' for locally installed header
+          files *instead* of `/usr/local/include'.
+
+          You should specify `--with-local-prefix' *only* if your site
+          has a different convention (not `/usr/local') for where to put
+          site-specific files.
+
+          The default value for `--with-local-prefix' is `/usr/local'
+          regardless of the value of `--prefix'.  Specifying `--prefix'
+          has no effect on which directory GNU CC searches for local
+          header files.  This may seem counterintuitive, but actually
+          it is logical.
+
+          The purpose of `--prefix' is to specify where to *install GNU
+          CC*.  The local header files in `/usr/local/include'--if you
+          put any in that directory--are not part of GNU CC.  They are
+          part of other programs--perhaps many others.  (GNU CC
+          installs its own header files in another directory which is
+          based on the `--prefix' value.)
+
+          *Do not* specify `/usr' as the `--with-local-prefix'!  The
+          directory you use for `--with-local-prefix' *must not* contain
+          any of the system's standard header files.  If it did contain
+          them, certain programs would be miscompiled (including GNU
+          Emacs, on certain targets), because this would override and
+          nullify the header file corrections made by the `fixincludes'
+          script.
+
+          Indications are that people who use this option use it based
+          on mistaken ideas of what it is for.  People use it as if it
+          specified where to install part of GNU CC.  Perhaps they make
+          this assumption because installing GNU CC creates the
+          directory.
+
+  8. Build the compiler.  Just type `make LANGUAGES=c' in the compiler
+     directory.
+
+     `LANGUAGES=c' specifies that only the C compiler should be
+     compiled.  The makefile normally builds compilers for all the
+     supported languages; currently, C, C++ and Objective C.  However,
+     C is the only language that is sure to work when you build with
+     other non-GNU C compilers.  In addition, building anything but C
+     at this stage is a waste of time.
+
+     In general, you can specify the languages to build by typing the
+     argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"', where LIST is one or more words from
+     the list `c', `c++', and `objective-c'.  If you have any
+     additional GNU compilers as subdirectories of the GNU CC source
+     directory, you may also specify their names in this list.
+
+     Ignore any warnings you may see about "statement not reached" in
+     `insn-emit.c'; they are normal.  Also, warnings about "unknown
+     escape sequence" are normal in `genopinit.c' and perhaps some
+     other files.  Likewise, you should ignore warnings about "constant
+     is so large that it is unsigned" in `insn-emit.c' and
+     `insn-recog.c', a warning about a comparison always being zero in
+     `enquire.o', and warnings about shift counts exceeding type widths
+     in `cexp.y'.  Any other compilation errors may represent bugs in
+     the port to your machine or operating system, and should be
+     investigated and reported (*note Bugs::.).
+
+     Some compilers fail to compile GNU CC because they have bugs or
+     limitations.  For example, the Microsoft compiler is said to run
+     out of macro space.  Some Ultrix compilers run out of expression
+     space; then you need to break up the statement where the problem
+     happens.
+
+  9. If you are building a cross-compiler, stop here.  *Note
+     Cross-Compiler::.
+
+ 10. Move the first-stage object files and executables into a
+     subdirectory with this command:
+
+          make stage1
+
+     The files are moved into a subdirectory named `stage1'.  Once
+     installation is complete, you may wish to delete these files with
+     `rm -r stage1'.
+
+ 11. If you have chosen a configuration for GNU CC which requires other
+     GNU tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard
+     system tools, install the required tools in the `stage1'
+     subdirectory under the names `as', `ld' or whatever is
+     appropriate.  This will enable the stage 1 compiler to find the
+     proper tools in the following stage.
+
+     Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of
+     the `PATH' environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools
+     come before the standard system tools.
+
+ 12. Recompile the compiler with itself, with this command:
+
+          make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O2"
+
+     This is called making the stage 2 compiler.
+
+     The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
+     languages.  If you don't want them all, you can specify the
+     languages to build by typing the argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"'.  LIST
+     should contain one or more words from the list `c', `c++',
+     `objective-c', and `proto'.  Separate the words with spaces.
+     `proto' stands for the programs `protoize' and `unprotoize'; they
+     are not a separate language, but you use `LANGUAGES' to enable or
+     disable their installation.
+
+     If you are going to build the stage 3 compiler, then you might
+     want to build only the C language in stage 2.
+
+     Once you have built the stage 2 compiler, if you are short of disk
+     space, you can delete the subdirectory `stage1'.
+
+     On a 68000 or 68020 system lacking floating point hardware, unless
+     you have selected a `tm.h' file that expects by default that there
+     is no such hardware, do this instead:
+
+          make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msoft-float"
+
+ 13. If you wish to test the compiler by compiling it with itself one
+     more time, install any other necessary GNU tools (such as GAS or
+     the GNU linker) in the `stage2' subdirectory as you did in the
+     `stage1' subdirectory, then do this:
+
+          make stage2
+          make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O2"
+
+     This is called making the stage 3 compiler.  Aside from the `-B'
+     option, the compiler options should be the same as when you made
+     the stage 2 compiler.  But the `LANGUAGES' option need not be the
+     same.  The command shown above builds compilers for all the
+     supported languages; if you don't want them all, you can specify
+     the languages to build by typing the argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"',
+     as described above.
+
+     If you do not have to install any additional GNU tools, you may
+     use the command
+
+          make bootstrap LANGUAGES=LANGUAGE-LIST BOOT_CFLAGS=OPTION-LIST
+
+     instead of making `stage1', `stage2', and performing the two
+     compiler builds.
+
+ 14. Compare the latest object files with the stage 2 object files--they
+     ought to be identical, aside from time stamps (if any).
+
+     On some systems, meaningful comparison of object files is
+     impossible; they always appear "different."  This is currently
+     true on Solaris and some systems that use ELF object file format.
+     On some versions of Irix on SGI machines and DEC Unix (OSF/1) on
+     Alpha systems, you will not be able to compare the files without
+     specifying `-save-temps'; see the description of individual
+     systems above to see if you get comparison failures.  You may have
+     similar problems on other systems.
+
+     Use this command to compare the files:
+
+          make compare
+
+     This will mention any object files that differ between stage 2 and
+     stage 3.  Any difference, no matter how innocuous, indicates that
+     the stage 2 compiler has compiled GNU CC incorrectly, and is
+     therefore a potentially serious bug which you should investigate
+     and report (*note Bugs::.).
+
+     If your system does not put time stamps in the object files, then
+     this is a faster way to compare them (using the Bourne shell):
+
+          for file in *.o; do
+          cmp $file stage2/$file
+          done
+
+     If you have built the compiler with the `-mno-mips-tfile' option on
+     MIPS machines, you will not be able to compare the files.
+
+ 15. Install the compiler driver, the compiler's passes and run-time
+     support with `make install'.  Use the same value for `CC',
+     `CFLAGS' and `LANGUAGES' that you used when compiling the files
+     that are being installed.  One reason this is necessary is that
+     some versions of Make have bugs and recompile files gratuitously
+     when you do this step.  If you use the same variable values, those
+     files will be recompiled properly.
+
+     For example, if you have built the stage 2 compiler, you can use
+     the following command:
+
+          make install CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O" LANGUAGES="LIST"
+
+     This copies the files `cc1', `cpp' and `libgcc.a' to files `cc1',
+     `cpp' and `libgcc.a' in the directory
+     `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION', which is where the
+     compiler driver program looks for them.  Here TARGET is the
+     canonicalized form of target machine type specified when you ran
+     `configure', and VERSION is the version number of GNU CC.  This
+     naming scheme permits various versions and/or cross-compilers to
+     coexist.  It also copies the executables for compilers for other
+     languages (e.g., `cc1plus' for C++) to the same directory.
+
+     This also copies the driver program `xgcc' into
+     `/usr/local/bin/gcc', so that it appears in typical execution
+     search paths.  It also copies `gcc.1' into `/usr/local/man/man1'
+     and info pages into `/usr/local/info'.
+
+     On some systems, this command causes recompilation of some files.
+     This is usually due to bugs in `make'.  You should either ignore
+     this problem, or use GNU Make.
+
+     *Warning: there is a bug in `alloca' in the Sun library.  To avoid
+     this bug, be sure to install the executables of GNU CC that were
+     compiled by GNU CC.  (That is, the executables from stage 2 or 3,
+     not stage 1.)  They use `alloca' as a built-in function and never
+     the one in the library.*
+
+     (It is usually better to install GNU CC executables from stage 2
+     or 3, since they usually run faster than the ones compiled with
+     some other compiler.)
+
+ 16. If you're going to use C++, you need to install the C++ runtime
+     library.  This includes all I/O functionality, special class
+     libraries, etc.
+
+     The standard C++ runtime library for GNU CC is called `libstdc++'.
+     An obsolescent library `libg++' may also be available, but it's
+     necessary only for older software that hasn't been converted yet;
+     if you don't know whether you need `libg++' then you probably don't
+     need it.
+
+     Here's one way to build and install `libstdc++' for GNU CC:
+
+        * Build and install GNU CC, so that invoking `gcc' obtains the
+          GNU CC that was just built.
+
+        * Obtain a copy of a compatible `libstdc++' distribution.  For
+          example, the `libstdc++-2.8.0.tar.gz' distribution should be
+          compatible with GCC 2.8.0.  GCC distributors normally
+          distribute `libstdc++' as well.
+
+        * Set the `CXX' environment variable to `gcc' while running the
+          `libstdc++' distribution's `configure' command.  Use the same
+          `configure' options that you used when you invoked GCC's
+          `configure' command.
+
+        * Invoke `make' to build the C++ runtime.
+
+        * Invoke `make install' to install the C++ runtime.
+
+     To summarize, after building and installing GNU CC, invoke the
+     following shell commands in the topmost directory of the C++
+     library distribution.  For CONFIGURE-OPTIONS, use the same options
+     that you used to configure GNU CC.
+
+          $ CXX=gcc ./configure CONFIGURE-OPTIONS
+          $ make
+          $ make install
+
+ 17. GNU CC includes a runtime library for Objective-C because it is an
+     integral part of the language.  You can find the files associated
+     with the library in the subdirectory `objc'.  The GNU Objective-C
+     Runtime Library requires header files for the target's C library in
+     order to be compiled,and also requires the header files for the
+     target's thread library if you want thread support.  *Note
+     Cross-Compilers and Header Files: Cross Headers, for discussion
+     about header files issues for cross-compilation.
+
+     When you run `configure', it picks the appropriate Objective-C
+     thread implementation file for the target platform.  In some
+     situations, you may wish to choose a different back-end as some
+     platforms support multiple thread implementations or you may wish
+     to disable thread support completely.  You do this by specifying a
+     value for the OBJC_THREAD_FILE makefile variable on the command
+     line when you run make, for example:
+
+          make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O2" OBJC_THREAD_FILE=thr-single
+
+     Below is a list of the currently available back-ends.
+
+        * thr-single Disable thread support, should work for all
+          platforms.
+
+        * thr-decosf1 DEC OSF/1 thread support.
+
+        * thr-irix SGI IRIX thread support.
+
+        * thr-mach Generic MACH thread support, known to work on
+          NEXTSTEP.
+
+        * thr-os2 IBM OS/2 thread support.
+
+        * thr-posix Generix POSIX thread support.
+
+        * thr-pthreads PCThreads on Linux-based GNU systems.
+
+        * thr-solaris SUN Solaris thread support.
+
+        * thr-win32 Microsoft Win32 API thread support.

+
+Files Created by `configure'
+============================
+
+   Here we spell out what files will be set up by `configure'.  Normally
+you need not be concerned with these files.
+
+   * A file named `config.h' is created that contains a `#include' of
+     the top-level config file for the machine you will run the compiler
+     on (*note Config::.).  This file is responsible for defining
+     information about the host machine.  It includes `tm.h'.
+
+     The top-level config file is located in the subdirectory `config'.
+     Its name is always `xm-SOMETHING.h'; usually `xm-MACHINE.h', but
+     there are some exceptions.
+
+     If your system does not support symbolic links, you might want to
+     set up `config.h' to contain a `#include' command which refers to
+     the appropriate file.
+
+   * A file named `tconfig.h' is created which includes the top-level
+     config file for your target machine.  This is used for compiling
+     certain programs to run on that machine.
+
+   * A file named `tm.h' is created which includes the
+     machine-description macro file for your target machine.  It should
+     be in the subdirectory `config' and its name is often `MACHINE.h'.
+
+   * The command file `configure' also constructs the file `Makefile'
+     by adding some text to the template file `Makefile.in'.  The
+     additional text comes from files in the `config' directory, named
+     `t-TARGET' and `x-HOST'.  If these files do not exist, it means
+     nothing needs to be added for a given target or host.

+Configurations Supported by GNU CC
+==================================
+
+   Here are the possible CPU types:
+
+     1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, cN, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, h8300,
+     hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i586, i860, i960, m32r,
+     m68000, m68k, m88k, mips, mipsel, mips64, mips64el, ns32k,
+     powerpc, powerpcle, pyramid, romp, rs6000, sh, sparc, sparclite,
+     sparc64, vax, we32k.
+
+   Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
+abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.
+
+     acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, apple, att, bull, cbm, convergent,
+     convex, crds, dec, dg, dolphin, elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi,
+     hp, ibm, intergraph, isi, mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron,
+     plexus, sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom, wrs.
+
+   The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
+the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
+just `CPU-SYSTEM', if it is not needed.  For example, `vax-ultrix4.2'
+is equivalent to `vax-dec-ultrix4.2'.
+
+   Here is a list of system types:
+
+     386bsd, aix, acis, amigaos, aos, aout, aux, bosx, bsd, clix, coff,
+     ctix, cxux, dgux, dynix, ebmon, ecoff, elf, esix, freebsd, hms,
+     genix, gnu, linux-gnu, hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna, lynxos,
+     mach, minix, msdos, mvs, netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf, osfrose,
+     ptx, riscix, riscos, rtu, sco, sim, solaris, sunos, sym, sysv,
+     udi, ultrix, unicos, uniplus, unos, vms, vsta, vxworks, winnt,
+     xenix.
+
+You can omit the system type; then `configure' guesses the operating
+system from the CPU and company.
+
+   You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
+make a difference.  For example, you can write `bsd4.3' or `bsd4.4' to
+distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version number is most
+needed for `sysv3' and `sysv4', which are often treated differently.
+
+   If you specify an impossible combination such as `i860-dg-vms', then
+you may get an error message from `configure', or it may ignore part of
+the information and do the best it can with the rest.  `configure'
+always prints the canonical name for the alternative that it used.  GNU
+CC does not support all possible alternatives.
+
+   Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names
+are recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the
+machine name `sun3', mentioned above, is an alias for `m68k-sun'.
+Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
+popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
+machine names:
+
+     3300, 3b1, 3bN, 7300, altos3068, altos, apollo68, att-7300,
+     balance, convex-cN, crds, decstation-3100, decstation, delta,
+     encore, fx2800, gmicro, hp7NN, hp8NN, hp9k2NN, hp9k3NN, hp9k7NN,
+     hp9k8NN, iris4d, iris, isi68, m3230, magnum, merlin, miniframe,
+     mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next, pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc,
+     powerpcle, ps2, risc-news, rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3,
+     sun4, symmetry, tower-32, tower.
+
+Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
+name.  If you want to install your own homemade configuration files,
+you can use `local' as the company name to access them.  If you use
+configuration `CPU-local', the configuration name without the cpu prefix
+is used to form the configuration file names.
+
+   Thus, if you specify `m68k-local', configuration uses files
+`m68k.md', `local.h', `m68k.c', `xm-local.h', `t-local', and `x-local',
+all in the directory `config/m68k'.
+
+   Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or
+special things you must know:
+
+`1750a-*-*'
+     MIL-STD-1750A processors.
+
+     The MIL-STD-1750A cross configuration produces output for
+     `as1750', an assembler/linker available under the GNU Public
+     License for the 1750A. `as1750' can be obtained at
+     *ftp://ftp.fta-berlin.de/pub/crossgcc/1750gals/*.  A similarly
+     licensed simulator for the 1750A is available from same address.
+
+     You should ignore a fatal error during the building of libgcc
+     (libgcc is not yet implemented for the 1750A.)
+
+     The `as1750' assembler requires the file `ms1750.inc', which is
+     found in the directory `config/1750a'.
+
+     GNU CC produced the same sections as the Fairchild F9450 C
+     Compiler, namely:
+
+    `Normal'
+          The program code section.
+
+    `Static'
+          The read/write (RAM) data section.
+
+    `Konst'
+          The read-only (ROM) constants section.
+
+    `Init'
+          Initialization section (code to copy KREL to SREL).
+
+     The smallest addressable unit is 16 bits (BITS_PER_UNIT is 16).
+     This means that type `char' is represented with a 16-bit word per
+     character.  The 1750A's "Load/Store Upper/Lower Byte" instructions
+     are not used by GNU CC.
+
+`alpha-*-osf1'
+     Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture
+     and are running the DEC Unix (OSF/1) operating system, for example
+     the DEC Alpha AXP systems.CC.)
+
+     GNU CC writes a `.verstamp' directive to the assembler output file
+     unless it is built as a cross-compiler.  It gets the version to
+     use from the system header file `/usr/include/stamp.h'.  If you
+     install a new version of DEC Unix, you should rebuild GCC to pick
+     up the new version stamp.
+
+     Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture,
+     cross-compilers from 32-bit machines will not generate code as
+     efficient as that generated when the compiler is running on a
+     64-bit machine because many optimizations that depend on being
+     able to represent a word on the target in an integral value on the
+     host cannot be performed.  Building cross-compilers on the Alpha
+     for 32-bit machines has only been tested in a few cases and may
+     not work properly.
+
+     `make compare' may fail on old versions of DEC Unix unless you add
+     `-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the
+     assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
+     comparison fail if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2'
+     compilations.  The option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be
+     used for the assembler input file, instead of a randomly chosen
+     name in `/tmp'.  Do not add `-save-temps' unless the comparisons
+     fail without that option.  If you add `-save-temps', you will have
+     to manually delete the `.i' and `.s' files after each series of
+     compilations.
+
+     GNU CC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used
+     by DBX and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with
+     GDB.  See the discussion of the `--with-stabs' option of
+     `configure' above for more information on these formats and how to
+     select them.
+
+     There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line
+     numbers for ECOFF format when the `.align' directive is used.  To
+     work around this problem, GNU CC will not emit such alignment
+     directives while writing ECOFF format debugging information even
+     if optimization is being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the
+     very undesirable side-effect that code addresses when `-O' is
+     specified are different depending on whether or not `-g' is also
+     specified.
+
+     To avoid this behavior, specify `-gstabs+' and use GDB instead of
+     DBX.  DEC is now aware of this problem with the assembler and
+     hopes to provide a fix shortly.
+
+`arc-*-elf'
+     Argonaut ARC processor.  This configuration is intended for
+     embedded systems.
+
+`arm-*-aout'
+     Advanced RISC Machines ARM-family processors.  These are often
+     used in embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix
+     configurations.  This configuration corresponds to the basic
+     instruction sequences and will produce `a.out' format object
+     modules.
+
+     You may need to make a variant of the file `arm.h' for your
+     particular configuration.
+
+`arm-*-linuxaout'
+     Any of the ARM family processors running the Linux-based GNU
+     system with the `a.out' binary format (ELF is not yet supported).
+     You must use version 2.8.1.0.7 or later of the GNU/Linux binutils,
+     which you can download from `sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/GCC' and
+     other mirror sites for Linux-based GNU systems.
+
+`arm-*-riscix'
+     The ARM2 or ARM3 processor running RISC iX, Acorn's port of BSD
+     Unix.  If you are running a version of RISC iX prior to 1.2 then
+     you must specify the version number during configuration.  Note
+     that the assembler shipped with RISC iX does not support stabs
+     debugging information; a new version of the assembler, with stabs
+     support included, is now available from Acorn and via ftp
+     `ftp.acorn.com:/pub/riscix/as+xterm.tar.Z'.  To enable stabs
+     debugging, pass `--with-gnu-as' to configure.
+
+     You will need to install GNU `sed' before you can run configure.
+
+`a29k'
+     AMD Am29k-family processors.  These are normally used in embedded
+     applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.  This
+     configuration corresponds to AMD's standard calling sequence and
+     binary interface and is compatible with other 29k tools.
+
+     You may need to make a variant of the file `a29k.h' for your
+     particular configuration.
+
+`a29k-*-bsd'
+     AMD Am29050 used in a system running a variant of BSD Unix.
+
+`decstation-*'
+     MIPS-based DECstations can support three different personalities:
+     Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, and OSF/rose.  (Alpha-based DECstation products
+     have a configuration name beginning with `alpha-dec'.)  To
+     configure GCC for these platforms use the following configurations:
+
+    `decstation-ultrix'
+          Ultrix configuration.
+
+    `decstation-osf1'
+          Dec's version of OSF/1.
+
+    `decstation-osfrose'
+          Open Software Foundation reference port of OSF/1 which uses
+          the OSF/rose object file format instead of ECOFF.  Normally,
+          you would not select this configuration.
+
+     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
+     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
+     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
+     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
+     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
+     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
+     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
+     3000'.
+
+`elxsi-elxsi-bsd'
+     The Elxsi's C compiler has known limitations that prevent it from
+     compiling GNU C.  Please contact `mrs@cygnus.com' for more details.
+
+`dsp16xx'
+     A port to the AT&T DSP1610 family of processors.
+
+`h8300-*-*'
+     Hitachi H8/300 series of processors.
+
+     The calling convention and structure layout has changed in release
+     2.6.  All code must be recompiled.  The calling convention now
+     passes the first three arguments in function calls in registers.
+     Structures are no longer a multiple of 2 bytes.
+
+`hppa*-*-*'
+     There are several variants of the HP-PA processor which run a
+     variety of operating systems.  GNU CC must be configured to use
+     the correct processor type and operating system, or GNU CC will
+     not function correctly.  The easiest way to handle this problem is
+     to *not* specify a target when configuring GNU CC, the `configure'
+     script will try to automatically determine the right processor
+     type and operating system.
+
+     `-g' does not work on HP-UX, since that system uses a peculiar
+     debugging format which GNU CC does not know about.  However, `-g'
+     will work if you also use GAS and GDB in conjunction with GCC.  We
+     highly recommend using GAS for all HP-PA configurations.
+
+     You should be using GAS-2.6 (or later) along with GDB-4.16 (or
+     later).  These can be retrieved from all the traditional GNU ftp
+     archive sites.
+
+     On some versions of HP-UX, you will need to install GNU `sed'.
+
+     You will need to be install GAS into a directory before `/bin',
+     `/usr/bin', and `/usr/ccs/bin' in your search path.  You should
+     install GAS before you build GNU CC.
+
+     To enable debugging, you must configure GNU CC with the
+     `--with-gnu-as' option before building.
+
+`i370-*-*'
+     This port is very preliminary and has many known bugs.  We hope to
+     have a higher-quality port for this machine soon.
+
+`i386-*-linux-gnuoldld'
+     Use this configuration to generate `a.out' binaries on Linux-based
+     GNU systems if you do not have gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later
+     installed. This is an obsolete configuration.
+
+`i386-*-linux-gnuaout'
+     Use this configuration to generate `a.out' binaries on Linux-based
+     GNU systems. This configuration is being superseded. You must use
+     gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.
+
+`i386-*-linux-gnu'
+     Use this configuration to generate ELF binaries on Linux-based GNU
+     systems.  You must use gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.
+
+`i386-*-sco'
+     Compilation with RCC is recommended.  Also, it may be a good idea
+     to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that comes with the
+     system.
+
+`i386-*-sco3.2v4'
+     Use this configuration for SCO release 3.2 version 4.
+
+`i386-*-sco3.2v5*'
+     Use this for the SCO OpenServer Release family including 5.0.0,
+     5.0.2, 5.0.4, 5.0.5, Internet FastStart 1.0, and Internet
+     FastStart 1.1.
+
+     GNU CC can generate COFF binaries if you specify `-mcoff' or ELF
+     binaries, the default.    A full `make bootstrap' is recommended
+     so that an ELF compiler that builds ELF is generated.
+
+     You must have TLS597 from `ftp://ftp.sco.com/TLS' installed for ELF
+     C++ binaries to work correctly on releases before 5.0.4.
+
+     The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no charge
+     is normally required.  If, however, you must be able to use the GNU
+     assembler (perhaps you have complex asms) you must configure this
+     package `--with-gnu-as'.  To do this, install (cp or symlink)
+     gcc/as to your copy of the GNU assembler.  You must use a recent
+     version of GNU binutils; version 2.9.1 seems to work well.  If you
+     select this option, you will be unable to build COFF images.
+     Trying to do so will result in non-obvious failures.  In general,
+     the "-with-gnu-as" option isn't as well tested as the native
+     assembler.
+
+     *NOTE:* If you are building C++, you must follow the instructions
+     about invoking `make bootstrap' because the native OpenServer
+     compiler may build a `cc1plus' that will not correctly parse many
+     valid C++ programs.  You must do a `make bootstrap' if you are
+     building with the native compiler.
+
+`i386-*-isc'
+     It may be a good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the
+     malloc that comes with the system.
+
+     In ISC version 4.1, `sed' core dumps when building `deduced.h'.
+     Use the version of `sed' from version 4.0.
+
+`i386-*-esix'
+     It may be good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc
+     that comes with the system.
+
+`i386-ibm-aix'
+     You need to use GAS version 2.1 or later, and LD from GNU binutils
+     version 2.2 or later.
+
+`i386-sequent-bsd'
+     Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.
+
+`i386-sequent-ptx1*'
+`i386-sequent-ptx2*'
+     You must install GNU `sed' before running `configure'.
+
+`i386-sun-sunos4'
+     You may find that you need another version of GNU CC to begin
+     bootstrapping with, since the current version when built with the
+     system's own compiler seems to get an infinite loop compiling part
+     of `libgcc2.c'.  GNU CC version 2 compiled with GNU CC (any
+     version) seems not to have this problem.
+
+     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
+     Sun systems.
+
+`i[345]86-*-winnt3.5'
+     This version requires a GAS that has not yet been released.  Until
+     it is, you can get a prebuilt binary version via anonymous ftp from
+     `cs.washington.edu:pub/gnat' or `cs.nyu.edu:pub/gnat'. You must
+     also use the Microsoft header files from the Windows NT 3.5 SDK.
+     Find these on the CDROM in the `/mstools/h' directory dated
+     9/4/94.  You must use a fixed version of Microsoft linker made
+     especially for NT 3.5, which is also is available on the NT 3.5
+     SDK CDROM.  If you do not have this linker, can you also use the
+     linker from Visual C/C++ 1.0 or 2.0.
+
+     Installing GNU CC for NT builds a wrapper linker, called `ld.exe',
+     which mimics the behaviour of Unix `ld' in the specification of
+     libraries (`-L' and `-l').  `ld.exe' looks for both Unix and
+     Microsoft named libraries.  For example, if you specify `-lfoo',
+     `ld.exe' will look first for `libfoo.a' and then for `foo.lib'.
+
+     You may install GNU CC for Windows NT in one of two ways,
+     depending on whether or not you have a Unix-like shell and various
+     Unix-like utilities.
+
+       1. If you do not have a Unix-like shell and few Unix-like
+          utilities, you will use a DOS style batch script called
+          `configure.bat'.  Invoke it as `configure winnt' from an
+          MSDOS console window or from the program manager dialog box.
+          `configure.bat' assumes you have already installed and have
+          in your path a Unix-like `sed' program which is used to
+          create a working `Makefile' from `Makefile.in'.
+
+          `Makefile' uses the Microsoft Nmake program maintenance
+          utility and the Visual C/C++ V8.00 compiler to build GNU CC.
+          You need only have the utilities `sed' and `touch' to use
+          this installation method, which only automatically builds the
+          compiler itself.  You must then examine what `fixinc.winnt'
+          does, edit the header files by hand and build `libgcc.a'
+          manually.
+
+       2. The second type of installation assumes you are running a
+          Unix-like shell, have a complete suite of Unix-like utilities
+          in your path, and have a previous version of GNU CC already
+          installed, either through building it via the above
+          installation method or acquiring a pre-built binary.  In this
+          case, use the `configure' script in the normal fashion.
+
+`i860-intel-osf1'
+     This is the Paragon.  If you have version 1.0 of the operating
+     system, see *Note Installation Problems::, for special things you
+     need to do to compensate for peculiarities in the system.
+
+`*-lynx-lynxos'
+     LynxOS 2.2 and earlier comes with GNU CC 1.x already installed as
+     `/bin/gcc'.  You should compile with this instead of `/bin/cc'.
+     You can tell GNU CC to use the GNU assembler and linker, by
+     specifying `--with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld' when configuring.  These
+     will produce COFF format object files and executables;  otherwise
+     GNU CC will use the installed tools, which produce `a.out' format
+     executables.
+
+`m32r-*-elf'
+     Mitsubishi M32R processor.  This configuration is intended for
+     embedded systems.
+
+`m68000-hp-bsd'
+     HP 9000 series 200 running BSD.  Note that the C compiler that
+     comes with this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact
+     `law@cygnus.com' to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.
+
+`m68k-altos'
+     Altos 3068.  You must use the GNU assembler, linker and debugger.
+     Also, you must fix a kernel bug.  Details in the file
+     `README.ALTOS'.
+
+`m68k-apple-aux'
+     Apple Macintosh running A/UX.  You may configure GCC  to use
+     either the system assembler and linker or the GNU assembler and
+     linker.  You should use the GNU configuration if you can,
+     especially if you also want to use GNU C++.  You enabled that
+     configuration with + the `--with-gnu-as' and `--with-gnu-ld'
+     options to `configure'.
+
+     Note the C compiler that comes with this system cannot compile GNU
+     CC.  You can find binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping on
+     `jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov'.  You will also a patched version of
+     `/bin/ld' there that raises some of the arbitrary limits found in
+     the original.
+
+`m68k-att-sysv'
+     AT&T 3b1, a.k.a. 7300 PC.  Special procedures are needed to
+     compile GNU CC with this machine's standard C compiler, due to
+     bugs in that compiler.  You can bootstrap it more easily with
+     previous versions of GNU CC if you have them.
+
+     Installing GNU CC on the 3b1 is difficult if you do not already
+     have GNU CC running, due to bugs in the installed C compiler.
+     However, the following procedure might work.  We are unable to
+     test it.
+
+       1. Comment out the `#include "config.h"' line near the start of
+          `cccp.c' and do `make cpp'.  This makes a preliminary version
+          of GNU cpp.
+
+       2. Save the old `/lib/cpp' and copy the preliminary GNU cpp to
+          that file name.
+
+       3. Undo your change in `cccp.c', or reinstall the original
+          version, and do `make cpp' again.
+
+       4. Copy this final version of GNU cpp into `/lib/cpp'.
+
+       5. Replace every occurrence of `obstack_free' in the file
+          `tree.c' with `_obstack_free'.
+
+       6. Run `make' to get the first-stage GNU CC.
+
+       7. Reinstall the original version of `/lib/cpp'.
+
+       8. Now you can compile GNU CC with itself and install it in the
+          normal fashion.
+
+`m68k-bull-sysv'
+     Bull DPX/2 series 200 and 300 with BOS-2.00.45 up to BOS-2.01. GNU
+     CC works either with native assembler or GNU assembler. You can use
+     GNU assembler with native coff generation by providing
+     `--with-gnu-as' to the configure script or use GNU assembler with
+     dbx-in-coff encapsulation by providing `--with-gnu-as --stabs'.
+     For any problem with native assembler or for availability of the
+     DPX/2 port of GAS, contact `F.Pierresteguy@frcl.bull.fr'.
+
+`m68k-crds-unox'
+     Use `configure unos' for building on Unos.
+
+     The Unos assembler is named `casm' instead of `as'.  For some
+     strange reason linking `/bin/as' to `/bin/casm' changes the
+     behavior, and does not work.  So, when installing GNU CC, you
+     should install the following script as `as' in the subdirectory
+     where the passes of GCC are installed:
+
+          #!/bin/sh
+          casm $*
+
+     The default Unos library is named `libunos.a' instead of `libc.a'.
+     To allow GNU CC to function, either change all references to
+     `-lc' in `gcc.c' to `-lunos' or link `/lib/libc.a' to
+     `/lib/libunos.a'.
+
+     When compiling GNU CC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs
+     in the support of `alloca', do not use `-O' when making stage 2.
+     Then use the stage 2 compiler with `-O' to make the stage 3
+     compiler.  This compiler will have the same characteristics as the
+     usual stage 2 compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4
+     compiler and compare that with stage 3 to verify proper
+     compilation.
+
+     (Perhaps simply defining `ALLOCA' in `x-crds' as described in the
+     comments there will make the above paragraph superfluous.  Please
+     inform us of whether this works.)
+
+     Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you
+     will need a lot of memory.  5 Mb is barely enough if no other
+     tasks are running.  If linking `cc1' fails, try putting the object
+     files into a library and linking from that library.
+
+`m68k-hp-hpux'
+     HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX.  HP-UX version 8.0 has a
+     bug in the assembler that prevents compilation of GNU CC.  To fix
+     it, get patch PHCO_4484 from HP.
+
+     In addition, if you wish to use gas `--with-gnu-as' you must use
+     gas version 2.1 or later, and you must use the GNU linker version
+     2.1 or later.  Earlier versions of gas relied upon a program which
+     converted the gas output into the native HP-UX format, but that
+     program has not been kept up to date.  gdb does not understand
+     that native HP-UX format, so you must use gas if you wish to use
+     gdb.
+
+`m68k-sun'
+     Sun 3.  We do not provide a configuration file to use the Sun FPA
+     by default, because programs that establish signal handlers for
+     floating point traps inherently cannot work with the FPA.
+
+     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
+     Sun systems.
+
+`m88k-*-svr3'
+     Motorola m88k running the AT&T/Unisoft/Motorola V.3 reference port.
+     These systems tend to use the Green Hills C, revision 1.8.5, as the
+     standard C compiler.  There are apparently bugs in this compiler
+     that result in object files differences between stage 2 and stage
+     3.  If this happens, make the stage 4 compiler and compare it to
+     the stage 3 compiler.  If the stage 3 and stage 4 object files are
+     identical, this suggests you encountered a problem with the
+     standard C compiler; the stage 3 and 4 compilers may be usable.
+
+     It is best, however, to use an older version of GNU CC for
+     bootstrapping if you have one.
+
+`m88k-*-dgux'
+     Motorola m88k running DG/UX.  To build 88open BCS native or cross
+     compilers on DG/UX, specify the configuration name as
+     `m88k-*-dguxbcs' and build in the 88open BCS software development
+     environment.  To build ELF native or cross compilers on DG/UX,
+     specify `m88k-*-dgux' and build in the DG/UX ELF development
+     environment.  You set the software development environment by
+     issuing `sde-target' command and specifying either `m88kbcs' or
+     `m88kdguxelf' as the operand.
+
+     If you do not specify a configuration name, `configure' guesses the
+     configuration based on the current software development
+     environment.
+
+`m88k-tektronix-sysv3'
+     Tektronix XD88 running UTekV 3.2e.  Do not turn on optimization
+     while building stage1 if you bootstrap with the buggy Green Hills
+     compiler.  Also, The bundled LAI System V NFS is buggy so if you
+     build in an NFS mounted directory, start from a fresh reboot, or
+     avoid NFS all together.  Otherwise you may have trouble getting
+     clean comparisons between stages.
+
+`mips-mips-bsd'
+     MIPS machines running the MIPS operating system in BSD mode.  It's
+     possible that some old versions of the system lack the functions
+     `memcpy', `memcmp', and `memset'.  If your system lacks these, you
+     must remove or undo the definition of `TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS' in
+     `mips-bsd.h'.
+
+     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
+     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
+     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
+     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
+     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
+     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
+     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
+     3000'.
+
+`mips-mips-riscos*'
+     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
+     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
+     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
+     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
+     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
+     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
+     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
+     3000'.
+
+     MIPS computers running RISC-OS can support four different
+     personalities: default, BSD 4.3, System V.3, and System V.4 (older
+     versions of RISC-OS don't support V.4).  To configure GCC for
+     these platforms use the following configurations:
+
+    `mips-mips-riscos`rev''
+          Default configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.
+
+    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'bsd'
+          BSD 4.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.
+
+    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'sysv4'
+          System V.4 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.
+
+    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'sysv'
+          System V.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.
+
+     The revision `rev' mentioned above is the revision of RISC-OS to
+     use.  You must reconfigure GCC when going from a RISC-OS revision
+     4 to RISC-OS revision 5.  This has the effect of avoiding a linker
+     bug (see *Note Installation Problems::, for more details).
+
+`mips-sgi-*'
+     In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 4, the "c.hdr.lib"
+     option must be installed from the CD-ROM supplied from Silicon
+     Graphics.  This is found on the 2nd CD in release 4.0.1.
+
+     In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 5, the
+     "compiler_dev.hdr" subsystem must be installed from the IDO CD-ROM
+     supplied by Silicon Graphics.
+
+     `make compare' may fail on version 5 of IRIX unless you add
+     `-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the
+     assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
+     comparison fail if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2'
+     compilations.  The option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be
+     used for the assembler input file, instead of a randomly chosen
+     name in `/tmp'.  Do not add `-save-temps' unless the comparisons
+     fail without that option.  If you do you `-save-temps', you will
+     have to manually delete the `.i' and `.s' files after each series
+     of compilations.
+
+     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
+     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
+     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
+     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
+     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
+     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
+     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
+     3000'.
+
+     On Irix version 4.0.5F, and perhaps on some other versions as well,
+     there is an assembler bug that reorders instructions incorrectly.
+     To work around it, specify the target configuration
+     `mips-sgi-irix4loser'.  This configuration inhibits assembler
+     optimization.
+
+     In a compiler configured with target `mips-sgi-irix4', you can turn
+     off assembler optimization by using the `-noasmopt' option.  This
+     compiler option passes the option `-O0' to the assembler, to
+     inhibit reordering.
+
+     The `-noasmopt' option can be useful for testing whether a problem
+     is due to erroneous assembler reordering.  Even if a problem does
+     not go away with `-noasmopt', it may still be due to assembler
+     reordering--perhaps GNU CC itself was miscompiled as a result.
+
+     To enable debugging under Irix 5, you must use GNU as 2.5 or later,
+     and use the `--with-gnu-as' configure option when configuring gcc.
+     GNU as is distributed as part of the binutils package.
+
+`mips-sony-sysv'
+     Sony MIPS NEWS.  This works in NEWSOS 5.0.1, but not in 5.0.2
+     (which uses ELF instead of COFF).  Support for 5.0.2 will probably
+     be provided soon by volunteers.  In particular, the linker does
+     not like the code generated by GCC when shared libraries are
+     linked in.
+
+`ns32k-encore'
+     Encore ns32000 system.  Encore systems are supported only under
+     BSD.
+
+`ns32k-*-genix'
+     National Semiconductor ns32000 system.  Genix has bugs in `alloca'
+     and `malloc'; you must get the compiled versions of these from GNU
+     Emacs.
+
+`ns32k-sequent'
+     Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.
+
+`ns32k-utek'
+     UTEK ns32000 system ("merlin").  The C compiler that comes with
+     this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact `tektronix!reed!mason'
+     to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.
+
+`romp-*-aos'
+`romp-*-mach'
+     The only operating systems supported for the IBM RT PC are AOS and
+     MACH.  GNU CC does not support AIX running on the RT.  We
+     recommend you compile GNU CC with an earlier version of itself; if
+     you compile GNU CC with `hc', the Metaware compiler, it will work,
+     but you will get mismatches between the stage 2 and stage 3
+     compilers in various files.  These errors are minor differences in
+     some floating-point constants and can be safely ignored; the stage
+     3 compiler is correct.
+
+`rs6000-*-aix'
+`powerpc-*-aix'
+     Various early versions of each release of the IBM XLC compiler
+     will not bootstrap GNU CC.  Symptoms include differences between
+     the stage2 and stage3 object files, and errors when compiling
+     `libgcc.a' or `enquire'.  Known problematic releases include:
+     xlc-1.2.1.8, xlc-1.3.0.0 (distributed with AIX 3.2.5), and
+     xlc-1.3.0.19.  Both xlc-1.2.1.28 and xlc-1.3.0.24 (PTF 432238) are
+     known to produce working versions of GNU CC, but most other recent
+     releases correctly bootstrap GNU CC.
+
+     Release 4.3.0 of AIX and ones prior to AIX 3.2.4 include a version
+     of the IBM assembler which does not accept debugging directives:
+     assembler updates are available as PTFs.  Also, if you are using
+     AIX 3.2.5 or greater and the GNU assembler, you must have a
+     version modified after October 16th, 1995 in order for the GNU C
+     compiler to build.  See the file `README.RS6000' for more details
+     on any of these problems.
+
+     GNU CC does not yet support the 64-bit PowerPC instructions.
+
+     Objective C does not work on this architecture because it makes
+     assumptions that are incompatible with the calling conventions.
+
+     AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside
+     of the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
+     locale-specific representations of various objects including
+     floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal
+     fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library
+     linked with GNU CC does not produce the same floating-point
+     formats that the assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set
+     the LANG environment variable to "C" or "En_US".
+
+     Due to changes in the way that GNU CC invokes the binder (linker)
+     for AIX 4.1, you may now receive warnings of duplicate symbols
+     from the link step that were not reported before.  The assembly
+     files generated by GNU CC for AIX have always included multiple
+     symbol definitions for certain global variable and function
+     declarations in the original program.  The warnings should not
+     prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
+     executable.
+
+     By default, AIX 4.1 produces code that can be used on either Power
+     or PowerPC processors.

+
+`vax-dec-ultrix'
+     Don't try compiling with Vax C (`vcc').  It produces incorrect code
+     in some cases (for example, when `alloca' is used).
+
+     Meanwhile, compiling `cp/parse.c' with pcc does not work because of
+     an internal table size limitation in that compiler.  To avoid this
+     problem, compile just the GNU C compiler first, and use it to
+     recompile building all the languages that you want to run.
+
+`sparc-sun-*'
+     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
+     Sun systems.
+
+`vax-dec-vms'
+     See *Note VMS Install::, for details on how to install GNU CC on
+     VMS.
+
+`we32k-*-*'
+     These computers are also known as the 3b2, 3b5, 3b20 and other
+     similar names.  (However, the 3b1 is actually a 68000; see *Note
+     Configurations::.)
+
+     Don't use `-g' when compiling with the system's compiler.  The
+     system's linker seems to be unable to handle such a large program
+     with debugging information.
+
+     The system's compiler runs out of capacity when compiling `stmt.c'
+     in GNU CC.  You can work around this by building `cpp' in GNU CC
+     first, then use that instead of the system's preprocessor with the
+     system's C compiler to compile `stmt.c'.  Here is how:
+
+          mv /lib/cpp /lib/cpp.att
+          cp cpp /lib/cpp.gnu
+          echo '/lib/cpp.gnu -traditional ${1+"$@"}' > /lib/cpp
+          chmod +x /lib/cpp
+
+     The system's compiler produces bad code for some of the GNU CC
+     optimization files.  So you must build the stage 2 compiler without
+     optimization.  Then build a stage 3 compiler with optimization.
+     That executable should work.  Here are the necessary commands:
+
+          make LANGUAGES=c CC=stage1/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage1/ -g"
+          make stage2
+          make CC=stage2/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage2/ -g -O"
+
+     You may need to raise the ULIMIT setting to build a C++ compiler,
+     as the file `cc1plus' is larger than one megabyte.

+
+Compilation in a Separate Directory
+===================================
+
+   If you wish to build the object files and executables in a directory
+other than the one containing the source files, here is what you must
+do differently:
+
+  1. Make sure you have a version of Make that supports the `VPATH'
+     feature.  (GNU Make supports it, as do Make versions on most BSD
+     systems.)
+
+  2. If you have ever run `configure' in the source directory, you must
+     undo the configuration.  Do this by running:
+
+          make distclean
+
+  3. Go to the directory in which you want to build the compiler before
+     running `configure':
+
+          mkdir gcc-sun3
+          cd gcc-sun3
+
+     On systems that do not support symbolic links, this directory must
+     be on the same file system as the source code directory.
+
+  4. Specify where to find `configure' when you run it:
+
+          ../gcc/configure ...
+
+     This also tells `configure' where to find the compiler sources;
+     `configure' takes the directory from the file name that was used to
+     invoke it.  But if you want to be sure, you can specify the source
+     directory with the `--srcdir' option, like this:
+
+          ../gcc/configure --srcdir=../gcc OTHER OPTIONS
+
+     The directory you specify with `--srcdir' need not be the same as
+     the one that `configure' is found in.
+
+   Now, you can run `make' in that directory.  You need not repeat the
+configuration steps shown above, when ordinary source files change.  You
+must, however, run `configure' again when the configuration files
+change, if your system does not support symbolic links.

+
+Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler
+========================================
+
+   GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not
+all.
+
+   * Cross-compilers for the Mips as target using the Mips assembler
+     currently do not work, because the auxiliary programs
+     `mips-tdump.c' and `mips-tfile.c' can't be compiled on anything
+     but a Mips.  It does work to cross compile for a Mips if you use
+     the GNU assembler and linker.
+
+   * Cross-compilers between machines with different floating point
+     formats have not all been made to work.  GNU CC now has a floating
+     point emulator with which these can work, but each target machine
+     description needs to be updated to take advantage of it.
+
+   * Cross-compilation between machines of different word sizes is
+     somewhat problematic and sometimes does not work.
+
+   Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
+cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files.
+If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
+cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
+for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.
+
+* Menu:

+
+Steps of Cross-Compilation
+--------------------------
+
+   To compile and run a program using a cross-compiler involves several
+steps:
+
+   * Run the cross-compiler on the host machine to produce assembler
+     files for the target machine.  This requires header files for the
+     target machine.
+
+   * Assemble the files produced by the cross-compiler.  You can do this
+     either with an assembler on the target machine, or with a
+     cross-assembler on the host machine.
+
+   * Link those files to make an executable.  You can do this either
+     with a linker on the target machine, or with a cross-linker on the
+     host machine.  Whichever machine you use, you need libraries and
+     certain startup files (typically `crt....o') for the target
+     machine.
+
+   It is most convenient to do all of these steps on the same host
+machine, since then you can do it all with a single invocation of GNU
+CC.  This requires a suitable cross-assembler and cross-linker.  For
+some targets, the GNU assembler and linker are available.
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Configure Cross,  Next: Tools and Libraries,  Prev: Steps of Cross,  Up: Cross-Compiler
+
+Configuring a Cross-Compiler
+----------------------------
+
+   To build GNU CC as a cross-compiler, you start out by running
+`configure'.  Use the `--target=TARGET' to specify the target type.  If
+`configure' was unable to correctly identify the system you are running
+on, also specify the `--build=BUILD' option.  For example, here is how
+to configure for a cross-compiler that produces code for an HP 68030
+system running BSD on a system that `configure' can correctly identify:
+
+     ./configure --target=m68k-hp-bsd4.3
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Tools and Libraries,  Next: Cross Headers,  Prev: Configure Cross,  Up: Cross-Compiler
+
+Tools and Libraries for a Cross-Compiler
+----------------------------------------
+
+   If you have a cross-assembler and cross-linker available, you should
+install them now.  Put them in the directory `/usr/local/TARGET/bin'.
+Here is a table of the tools you should put in this directory:
+
+`as'
+     This should be the cross-assembler.
+
+`ld'
+     This should be the cross-linker.
+
+`ar'
+     This should be the cross-archiver: a program which can manipulate
+     archive files (linker libraries) in the target machine's format.
+
+`ranlib'
+     This should be a program to construct a symbol table in an archive
+     file.
+
+   The installation of GNU CC will find these programs in that
+directory, and copy or link them to the proper place to for the
+cross-compiler to find them when run later.
+
+   The easiest way to provide these files is to build the Binutils
+package and GAS.  Configure them with the same `--host' and `--target'
+options that you use for configuring GNU CC, then build and install
+them.  They install their executables automatically into the proper
+directory.  Alas, they do not support all the targets that GNU CC
+supports.
+
+   If you want to install libraries to use with the cross-compiler,
+such as a standard C library, put them in the directory
+`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'; installation of GNU CC copies all the files in
+that subdirectory into the proper place for GNU CC to find them and
+link with them.  Here's an example of copying some libraries from a
+target machine:
+
+     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
+     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
+     cd /lib
+     get libc.a
+     cd /usr/lib
+     get libg.a
+     get libm.a
+     quit
+
+The precise set of libraries you'll need, and their locations on the
+target machine, vary depending on its operating system.
+
+   Many targets require "start files" such as `crt0.o' and `crtn.o'
+which are linked into each executable; these too should be placed in
+`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'.  There may be several alternatives for
+`crt0.o', for use with profiling or other compilation options.  Check
+your target's definition of `STARTFILE_SPEC' to find out what start
+files it uses.  Here's an example of copying these files from a target
+machine:
+
+     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
+     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
+     prompt
+     cd /lib
+     mget *crt*.o
+     cd /usr/lib
+     mget *crt*.o
+     quit

+`libgcc.a' and Cross-Compilers
+------------------------------
+
+   Code compiled by GNU CC uses certain runtime support functions
+implicitly.  Some of these functions can be compiled successfully with
+GNU CC itself, but a few cannot be.  These problem functions are in the
+source file `libgcc1.c'; the library made from them is called
+`libgcc1.a'.
+
+   When you build a native compiler, these functions are compiled with
+some other compiler-the one that you use for bootstrapping GNU CC.
+Presumably it knows how to open code these operations, or else knows how
+to call the run-time emulation facilities that the machine comes with.
+But this approach doesn't work for building a cross-compiler.  The
+compiler that you use for building knows about the host system, not the
+target system.
+
+   So, when you build a cross-compiler you have to supply a suitable
+library `libgcc1.a' that does the job it is expected to do.
+
+   To compile `libgcc1.c' with the cross-compiler itself does not work.
+The functions in this file are supposed to implement arithmetic
+operations that GNU CC does not know how to open code for your target
+machine.  If these functions are compiled with GNU CC itself, they will
+compile into infinite recursion.
+
+   On any given target, most of these functions are not needed.  If GNU
+CC can open code an arithmetic operation, it will not call these
+functions to perform the operation.  It is possible that on your target
+machine, none of these functions is needed.  If so, you can supply an
+empty library as `libgcc1.a'.
+
+   Many targets need library support only for multiplication and
+division.  If you are linking with a library that contains functions for
+multiplication and division, you can tell GNU CC to call them directly
+by defining the macros `MULSI3_LIBCALL', and the like.  These macros
+need to be defined in the target description macro file.  For some
+targets, they are defined already.  This may be sufficient to avoid the
+need for libgcc1.a; if so, you can supply an empty library.
+
+   Some targets do not have floating point instructions; they need other
+functions in `libgcc1.a', which do floating arithmetic.  Recent
+versions of GNU CC have a file which emulates floating point.  With a
+certain amount of work, you should be able to construct a floating
+point emulator that can be used as `libgcc1.a'.  Perhaps future
+versions will contain code to do this automatically and conveniently.
+That depends on whether someone wants to implement it.
+
+   Some embedded targets come with all the necessary `libgcc1.a'
+routines written in C or assembler.  These targets build `libgcc1.a'
+automatically and you do not need to do anything special for them.
+Other embedded targets do not need any `libgcc1.a' routines since all
+the necessary operations are supported by the hardware.
+
+   If your target system has another C compiler, you can configure GNU
+CC as a native compiler on that machine, build just `libgcc1.a' with
+`make libgcc1.a' on that machine, and use the resulting file with the
+cross-compiler.  To do this, execute the following on the target
+machine:
+
+     cd TARGET-BUILD-DIR
+     ./configure --host=sparc --target=sun3
+     make libgcc1.a
+
+And then this on the host machine:
+
+     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
+     binary
+     cd TARGET-BUILD-DIR
+     get libgcc1.a
+     quit
+
+   Another way to provide the functions you need in `libgcc1.a' is to
+define the appropriate `perform_...' macros for those functions.  If
+these definitions do not use the C arithmetic operators that they are
+meant to implement, you should be able to compile them with the
+cross-compiler you are building.  (If these definitions already exist
+for your target file, then you are all set.)
+
+   To build `libgcc1.a' using the perform macros, use
+`LIBGCC1=libgcc1.a OLDCC=./xgcc' when building the compiler.
+Otherwise, you should place your replacement library under the name
+`libgcc1.a' in the directory in which you will build the
+cross-compiler, before you run `make'.

+
+Cross-Compilers and Header Files
+--------------------------------
+
+   If you are cross-compiling a standalone program or a program for an
+embedded system, then you may not need any header files except the few
+that are part of GNU CC (and those of your program).  However, if you
+intend to link your program with a standard C library such as `libc.a',
+then you probably need to compile with the header files that go with
+the library you use.
+
+   The GNU C compiler does not come with these files, because (1) they
+are system-specific, and (2) they belong in a C library, not in a
+compiler.
+
+   If the GNU C library supports your target machine, then you can get
+the header files from there (assuming you actually use the GNU library
+when you link your program).
+
+   If your target machine comes with a C compiler, it probably comes
+with suitable header files also.  If you make these files accessible
+from the host machine, the cross-compiler can use them also.
+
+   Otherwise, you're on your own in finding header files to use when
+cross-compiling.
+
+   When you have found suitable header files, put them in the directory
+`/usr/local/TARGET/include', before building the cross compiler.  Then
+installation will run fixincludes properly and install the corrected
+versions of the header files where the compiler will use them.
+
+   Provide the header files before you build the cross-compiler, because
+the build stage actually runs the cross-compiler to produce parts of
+`libgcc.a'.  (These are the parts that *can* be compiled with GNU CC.)
+Some of them need suitable header files.
+
+   Here's an example showing how to copy the header files from a target
+machine.  On the target machine, do this:
+
+     (cd /usr/include; tar cf - .) > tarfile
+
+   Then, on the host machine, do this:
+
+     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
+     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/include
+     get tarfile
+     quit
+     tar xf tarfile

+
+Actually Building the Cross-Compiler
+------------------------------------
+
+   Now you can proceed just as for compiling a single-machine compiler
+through the step of building stage 1.  If you have not provided some
+sort of `libgcc1.a', then compilation will give up at the point where
+it needs that file, printing a suitable error message.  If you do
+provide `libgcc1.a', then building the compiler will automatically
+compile and link a test program called `libgcc1-test'; if you get
+errors in the linking, it means that not all of the necessary routines
+in `libgcc1.a' are available.
+
+   You must provide the header file `float.h'.  One way to do this is
+to compile `enquire' and run it on your target machine.  The job of
+`enquire' is to run on the target machine and figure out by experiment
+the nature of its floating point representation.  `enquire' records its
+findings in the header file `float.h'.  If you can't produce this file
+by running `enquire' on the target machine, then you will need to come
+up with a suitable `float.h' in some other way (or else, avoid using it
+in your programs).
+
+   Do not try to build stage 2 for a cross-compiler.  It doesn't work to
+rebuild GNU CC as a cross-compiler using the cross-compiler, because
+that would produce a program that runs on the target machine, not on the
+host.  For example, if you compile a 386-to-68030 cross-compiler with
+itself, the result will not be right either for the 386 (because it was
+compiled into 68030 code) or for the 68030 (because it was configured
+for a 386 as the host).  If you want to compile GNU CC into 68030 code,
+whether you compile it on a 68030 or with a cross-compiler on a 386, you
+must specify a 68030 as the host when you configure it.
+
+   To install the cross-compiler, use `make install', as usual.

+
+Installing GNU CC on the Sun
+============================
+
+   On Solaris, do not use the linker or other tools in `/usr/ucb' to
+build GNU CC.  Use `/usr/ccs/bin'.
+
+   If the assembler reports `Error: misaligned data' when bootstrapping,
+you are probably using an obsolete version of the GNU assembler.
+Upgrade to the latest version of GNU `binutils', or use the Solaris
+assembler.
+
+   Make sure the environment variable `FLOAT_OPTION' is not set when
+you compile `libgcc.a'.  If this option were set to `f68881' when
+`libgcc.a' is compiled, the resulting code would demand to be linked
+with a special startup file and would not link properly without special
+pains.
+
+   There is a bug in `alloca' in certain versions of the Sun library.
+To avoid this bug, install the binaries of GNU CC that were compiled by
+GNU CC.  They use `alloca' as a built-in function and never the one in
+the library.
+
+   Some versions of the Sun compiler crash when compiling GNU CC.  The
+problem is a segmentation fault in cpp.  This problem seems to be due to
+the bulk of data in the environment variables.  You may be able to avoid
+it by using the following command to compile GNU CC with Sun CC:
+
+     make CC="TERMCAP=x OBJS=x LIBFUNCS=x STAGESTUFF=x cc"
+
+   SunOS 4.1.3 and 4.1.3_U1 have bugs that can cause intermittent core
+dumps when compiling GNU CC.  A common symptom is an internal compiler
+error which does not recur if you run it again.  To fix the problem,
+install Sun recommended patch 100726 (for SunOS 4.1.3) or 101508 (for
+SunOS 4.1.3_U1), or upgrade to a later SunOS release.

+
+Installing GNU CC on VMS
+========================
+
+   The VMS version of GNU CC is distributed in a backup saveset
+containing both source code and precompiled binaries.
+
+   To install the `gcc' command so you can use the compiler easily, in
+the same manner as you use the VMS C compiler, you must install the VMS
+CLD file for GNU CC as follows:
+
+  1. Define the VMS logical names `GNU_CC' and `GNU_CC_INCLUDE' to
+     point to the directories where the GNU CC executables
+     (`gcc-cpp.exe', `gcc-cc1.exe', etc.) and the C include files are
+     kept respectively.  This should be done with the commands:
+
+          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
+            disk:[gcc.] gnu_cc
+          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
+            disk:[gcc.include.] gnu_cc_include
+
+     with the appropriate disk and directory names.  These commands can
+     be placed in your system startup file so they will be executed
+     whenever the machine is rebooted.  You may, if you choose, do this
+     via the `GCC_INSTALL.COM' script in the `[GCC]' directory.
+
+  2. Install the `GCC' command with the command line:
+
+          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
+            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables gnu_cc:[000000]gcc
+          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables
+
+  3. To install the help file, do the following:
+
+          $ library/help sys$library:helplib.hlb gcc.hlp
+
+     Now you can invoke the compiler with a command like `gcc /verbose
+     file.c', which is equivalent to the command `gcc -v -c file.c' in
+     Unix.
+
+   If you wish to use GNU C++ you must first install GNU CC, and then
+perform the following steps:
+
+  1. Define the VMS logical name `GNU_GXX_INCLUDE' to point to the
+     directory where the preprocessor will search for the C++ header
+     files.  This can be done with the command:
+
+          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
+            disk:[gcc.gxx_include.] gnu_gxx_include
+
+     with the appropriate disk and directory name.  If you are going to
+     be using a C++ runtime library, this is where its install
+     procedure will install its header files.
+
+  2. Obtain the file `gcc-cc1plus.exe', and place this in the same
+     directory that `gcc-cc1.exe' is kept.
+
+     The GNU C++ compiler can be invoked with a command like `gcc /plus
+     /verbose file.cc', which is equivalent to the command `g++ -v -c
+     file.cc' in Unix.
+
+   We try to put corresponding binaries and sources on the VMS
+distribution tape.  But sometimes the binaries will be from an older
+version than the sources, because we don't always have time to update
+them.  (Use the `/version' option to determine the version number of
+the binaries and compare it with the source file `version.c' to tell
+whether this is so.)  In this case, you should use the binaries you get
+to recompile the sources.  If you must recompile, here is how:
+
+  1. Execute the command procedure `vmsconfig.com' to set up the files
+     `tm.h', `config.h', `aux-output.c', and `md.', and to create files
+     `tconfig.h' and `hconfig.h'.  This procedure also creates several
+     linker option files used by `make-cc1.com' and a data file used by
+     `make-l2.com'.
+
+          $ @vmsconfig.com
+
+  2. Setup the logical names and command tables as defined above.  In
+     addition, define the VMS logical name `GNU_BISON' to point at the
+     to the directories where the Bison executable is kept.  This
+     should be done with the command:
+
+          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
+            disk:[bison.] gnu_bison
+
+     You may, if you choose, use the `INSTALL_BISON.COM' script in the
+     `[BISON]' directory.
+
+  3. Install the `BISON' command with the command line:
+
+          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
+            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
+            gnu_bison:[000000]bison
+          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables
+
+  4. Type `@make-gcc' to recompile everything (alternatively, submit
+     the file `make-gcc.com' to a batch queue).  If you wish to build
+     the GNU C++ compiler as well as the GNU CC compiler, you must
+     first edit `make-gcc.com' and follow the instructions that appear
+     in the comments.
+
+  5. In order to use GCC, you need a library of functions which GCC
+     compiled code will call to perform certain tasks, and these
+     functions are defined in the file `libgcc2.c'.  To compile this
+     you should use the command procedure `make-l2.com', which will
+     generate the library `libgcc2.olb'.  `libgcc2.olb' should be built
+     using the compiler built from the same distribution that
+     `libgcc2.c' came from, and `make-gcc.com' will automatically do
+     all of this for you.
+
+     To install the library, use the following commands:
+
+          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=(new,eprintf)
+          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=L_*
+          $ library libgcc2/extract=*/output=libgcc2.obj
+          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib libgcc2.obj
+
+     The first command simply removes old modules that will be replaced
+     with modules from `libgcc2' under different module names.  The
+     modules `new' and `eprintf' may not actually be present in your
+     `gcclib.olb'--if the VMS librarian complains about those modules
+     not being present, simply ignore the message and continue on with
+     the next command.  The second command removes the modules that
+     came from the previous version of the library `libgcc2.c'.
+
+     Whenever you update the compiler on your system, you should also
+     update the library with the above procedure.
+
+  6. You may wish to build GCC in such a way that no files are written
+     to the directory where the source files reside.  An example would
+     be the when the source files are on a read-only disk.  In these
+     cases, execute the following DCL commands (substituting your
+     actual path names):
+
+          $ assign dua0:[gcc.build_dir.]/translation=concealed, -
+                   dua1:[gcc.source_dir.]/translation=concealed  gcc_build
+          $ set default gcc_build:[000000]
+
+     where the directory `dua1:[gcc.source_dir]' contains the source
+     code, and the directory `dua0:[gcc.build_dir]' is meant to contain
+     all of the generated object files and executables.  Once you have
+     done this, you can proceed building GCC as described above.  (Keep
+     in mind that `gcc_build' is a rooted logical name, and thus the
+     device names in each element of the search list must be an actual
+     physical device name rather than another rooted logical name).
+
+  7. *If you are building GNU CC with a previous version of GNU CC, you
+     also should check to see that you have the newest version of the
+     assembler*.  In particular, GNU CC version 2 treats global constant
+     variables slightly differently from GNU CC version 1, and GAS
+     version 1.38.1 does not have the patches required to work with GCC
+     version 2.  If you use GAS 1.38.1, then `extern const' variables
+     will not have the read-only bit set, and the linker will generate
+     warning messages about mismatched psect attributes for these
+     variables.  These warning messages are merely a nuisance, and can
+     safely be ignored.
+
+     If you are compiling with a version of GNU CC older than 1.33,
+     specify `/DEFINE=("inline=")' as an option in all the
+     compilations.  This requires editing all the `gcc' commands in
+     `make-cc1.com'.  (The older versions had problems supporting
+     `inline'.)  Once you have a working 1.33 or newer GNU CC, you can
+     change this file back.
+
+  8. If you want to build GNU CC with the VAX C compiler, you will need
+     to make minor changes in `make-cccp.com' and `make-cc1.com' to
+     choose alternate definitions of `CC', `CFLAGS', and `LIBS'.  See
+     comments in those files.  However, you must also have a working
+     version of the GNU assembler (GNU as, aka GAS) as it is used as
+     the back-end for GNU CC to produce binary object modules and is
+     not included in the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also needed to compile
+     `libgcc2' in order to build `gcclib' (see above); `make-l2.com'
+     expects to be able to find it operational in
+     `gnu_cc:[000000]gnu-as.exe'.
+
+     To use GNU CC on VMS, you need the VMS driver programs `gcc.exe',
+     `gcc.com', and `gcc.cld'.  They are distributed with the VMS
+     binaries (`gcc-vms') rather than the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also
+     included in `gcc-vms', as is Bison.
+
+     Once you have successfully built GNU CC with VAX C, you should use
+     the resulting compiler to rebuild itself.  Before doing this, be
+     sure to restore the `CC', `CFLAGS', and `LIBS' definitions in
+     `make-cccp.com' and `make-cc1.com'.  The second generation
+     compiler will be able to take advantage of many optimizations that
+     must be suppressed when building with other compilers.
+
+   Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would
+occasionally give strange results when linked with the sharable
+`VAXCRTL' library.  Now this should work.
+
+   Even with this version, however, GNU CC itself should not be linked
+with the sharable `VAXCRTL'.  The version of `qsort' in `VAXCRTL' has a
+bug (known to be present in VMS versions V4.6 through V5.5) which
+causes the compiler to fail.
+
+   The executables are generated by `make-cc1.com' and `make-cccp.com'
+use the object library version of `VAXCRTL' in order to make use of the
+`qsort' routine in `gcclib.olb'.  If you wish to link the compiler
+executables with the shareable image version of `VAXCRTL', you should
+edit the file `tm.h' (created by `vmsconfig.com') to define the macro
+`QSORT_WORKAROUND'.
+
+   `QSORT_WORKAROUND' is always defined when GNU CC is compiled with
+VAX C, to avoid a problem in case `gcclib.olb' is not yet available.

+
+`collect2'
+==========
+
+   GNU CC uses a utility called `collect2' on nearly all systems to
+arrange to call various initialization functions at start time.
+
+   The program `collect2' works by linking the program once and looking
+through the linker output file for symbols with particular names
+indicating they are constructor functions.  If it finds any, it creates
+a new temporary `.c' file containing a table of them, compiles it, and
+links the program a second time including that file.
+
+   The actual calls to the constructors are carried out by a subroutine
+called `__main', which is called (automatically) at the beginning of
+the body of `main' (provided `main' was compiled with GNU CC).  Calling
+`__main' is necessary, even when compiling C code, to allow linking C
+and C++ object code together.  (If you use `-nostdlib', you get an
+unresolved reference to `__main', since it's defined in the standard
+GCC library.  Include `-lgcc' at the end of your compiler command line
+to resolve this reference.)
+
+   The program `collect2' is installed as `ld' in the directory where
+the passes of the compiler are installed.  When `collect2' needs to
+find the *real* `ld', it tries the following file names:
+
+   * `real-ld' in the directories listed in the compiler's search
+     directories.
+
+   * `real-ld' in the directories listed in the environment variable
+     `PATH'.
+
+   * The file specified in the `REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
+     if specified.
+
+   * `ld' in the compiler's search directories, except that `collect2'
+     will not execute itself recursively.
+
+   * `ld' in `PATH'.
+
+   "The compiler's search directories" means all the directories where
+`gcc' searches for passes of the compiler.  This includes directories
+that you specify with `-B'.
+
+   Cross-compilers search a little differently:
+
+   * `real-ld' in the compiler's search directories.
+
+   * `TARGET-real-ld' in `PATH'.
+
+   * The file specified in the `REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
+     if specified.
+
+   * `ld' in the compiler's search directories.
+
+   * `TARGET-ld' in `PATH'.
+
+   `collect2' explicitly avoids running `ld' using the file name under
+which `collect2' itself was invoked.  In fact, it remembers up a list
+of such names--in case one copy of `collect2' finds another copy (or
+version) of `collect2' installed as `ld' in a second place in the
+search path.
+
+   `collect2' searches for the utilities `nm' and `strip' using the
+same algorithm as above for `ld'.

+Standard Header File Directories
+================================
+
+   `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.  It is
+where GNU CC stores its private include files, and also where GNU CC
+stores the fixed include files.  A cross compiled GNU CC runs
+`fixincludes' on the header files in `$(tooldir)/include'.  (If the
+cross compilation header files need to be fixed, they must be installed
+before GNU CC is built.  If the cross compilation header files are
+already suitable for ANSI C and GNU CC, nothing special need be done).
+
+   `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.
+It is where `g++' looks first for header files.  The C++ library
+installs only target independent header files in that directory.
+
+   `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for a native compiler.  It is
+normally `/usr/local/include'.  GNU CC searches this directory so that
+users can install header files in `/usr/local/include'.
+
+   `CROSS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for a cross compiler.  GNU CC
+doesn't install anything there.
+
+   `TOOL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used for both native and cross compilers.  It
+is the place for other packages to install header files that GNU CC will
+use.  For a cross-compiler, this is the equivalent of `/usr/include'.
+When you build a cross-compiler, `fixincludes' processes any header
+files in this directory.

+Statements and Declarations in Expressions
+==========================================
+
+   A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an
+expression in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local
+variables within an expression.
+
+   Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements
+surrounded by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the
+braces.  For example:
+
+     ({ int y = foo (); int z;
+        if (y > 0) z = y;
+        else z = - y;
+        z; })
+
+is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression for
+the absolute value of `foo ()'.
+
+   The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
+followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
+value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
+last within the braces, the construct has type `void', and thus
+effectively no value.)
+
+   This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe"
+(so that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
+"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
+follows:
+
+     #define max(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
+
+But this definition computes either A or B twice, with bad results if
+the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the type of the
+operands (here let's assume `int'), you can define the macro safely as
+follows:
+
+     #define maxint(a,b) \
+       ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a > _b ? _a : _b; })
+
+   Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
+the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit field, or the
+initial value of a static variable.
+
+   If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this,
+but you must use `typeof' (*note Typeof::.) or type naming (*note
+Naming Types::.).
+

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Local Labels,  Next: Labels as Values,  Prev: Statement Exprs,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Locally Declared Labels
+=======================
+
+   Each statement expression is a scope in which "local labels" can be
+declared.  A local label is simply an identifier; you can jump to it
+with an ordinary `goto' statement, but only from within the statement
+expression it belongs to.
+
+   A local label declaration looks like this:
+
+     __label__ LABEL;
+
+or
+
+     __label__ LABEL1, LABEL2, ...;
+
+   Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the statement
+expression, right after the `({', before any ordinary declarations.
+
+   The label declaration defines the label *name*, but does not define
+the label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with `LABEL:',
+within the statements of the statement expression.
+
+   The local label feature is useful because statement expressions are
+often used in macros.  If the macro contains nested loops, a `goto' can
+be useful for breaking out of them.  However, an ordinary label whose
+scope is the whole function cannot be used: if the macro can be
+expanded several times in one function, the label will be multiply
+defined in that function.  A local label avoids this problem.  For
+example:
+
+     #define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
+     ({                                               \
+       __label__ found;                                \
+       typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
+       typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
+       int i, j;                                       \
+       int value;                                      \
+       for (i = 0; i < max; i++)                       \
+         for (j = 0; j < max; j++)                     \
+           if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
+             { value = i; goto found; }              \
+       value = -1;                                     \
+      found:                                           \
+       value;                                          \
+     })

+
+Labels as Values
+================
+
+   You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
+(or a containing function) with the unary operator `&&'.  The value has
+type `void *'.  This value is a constant and can be used wherever a
+constant of that type is valid.  For example:
+
+     void *ptr;
+     ...
+     ptr = &&foo;
+
+   To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is
+done with the computed goto statement(1), `goto *EXP;'.  For example,
+
+     goto *ptr;
+
+Any expression of type `void *' is allowed.
+
+   One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array
+that will serve as a jump table:
+
+     static void *array[] = { &&foo, &&bar, &&hack };
+
+   Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:
+
+     goto *array[i];
+
+Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds--array
+indexing in C never does that.
+
+   Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
+`switch' statement.  The `switch' statement is cleaner, so use that
+rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a `switch'
+statement very well.
+
+   Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code.
+The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the
+threaded code for super-fast dispatching.
+
+   You can use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function.
+If you do that, totally unpredictable things will happen.  The best way
+to avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables
+and never pass it as an argument.
+
+   ---------- Footnotes ----------
+
+   (1) The analogous feature in Fortran is called an assigned goto, but
+that name seems inappropriate in C, where one can do more than simply
+store label addresses in label variables.

+
+Nested Functions
+================
+
+   A "nested function" is a function defined inside another function.
+(Nested functions are not supported for GNU C++.)  The nested function's
+name is local to the block where it is defined.  For example, here we
+define a nested function named `square', and call it twice:
+
+     foo (double a, double b)
+     {
+       double square (double z) { return z * z; }
+     
+       return square (a) + square (b);
+     }
+
+   The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
+function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
+called "lexical scoping".  For example, here we show a nested function
+which uses an inherited variable named `offset':
+
+     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
+     {
+       int access (int *array, int index)
+         { return array[index + offset]; }
+       int i;
+       ...
+       for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
+         ... access (array, i) ...
+     }
+
+   Nested function definitions are permitted within functions in the
+places where variable definitions are allowed; that is, in any block,
+before the first statement in the block.
+
+   It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of
+its name by storing its address or passing the address to another
+function:
+
+     hack (int *array, int size)
+     {
+       void store (int index, int value)
+         { array[index] = value; }
+     
+       intermediate (store, size);
+     }
+
+   Here, the function `intermediate' receives the address of `store' as
+an argument.  If `intermediate' calls `store', the arguments given to
+`store' are used to store into `array'.  But this technique works only
+so long as the containing function (`hack', in this example) does not
+exit.
+
+   If you try to call the nested function through its address after the
+containing function has exited, all hell will break loose.  If you try
+to call it after a containing scope level has exited, and if it refers
+to some of the variables that are no longer in scope, you may be lucky,
+but it's not wise to take the risk.  If, however, the nested function
+does not refer to anything that has gone out of scope, you should be
+safe.
+
+   GNU CC implements taking the address of a nested function using a
+technique called "trampolines".   A paper describing them is available
+as `http://master.debian.org/~karlheg/Usenix88-lexic.pdf'.
+
+   A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
+function, provided the label was explicitly declared in the containing
+function (*note Local Labels::.).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
+containing function, exiting the nested function which did the `goto'
+and any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:
+
+     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
+     {
+       __label__ failure;
+       int access (int *array, int index)
+         {
+           if (index > size)
+             goto failure;
+           return array[index + offset];
+         }
+       int i;
+       ...
+       for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
+         ... access (array, i) ...
+       ...
+       return 0;
+     
+      /* Control comes here from `access'
+         if it detects an error.  */
+      failure:
+       return -1;
+     }
+
+   A nested function always has internal linkage.  Declaring one with
+`extern' is erroneous.  If you need to declare the nested function
+before its definition, use `auto' (which is otherwise meaningless for
+function declarations).
+
+     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
+     {
+       __label__ failure;
+       auto int access (int *, int);
+       ...
+       int access (int *array, int index)
+         {
+           if (index > size)
+             goto failure;
+           return array[index + offset];
+         }
+       ...
+     }

+
+Constructing Function Calls
+===========================
+
+   Using the built-in functions described below, you can record the
+arguments a function received, and call another function with the same
+arguments, without knowing the number or types of the arguments.
+
+   You can also record the return value of that function call, and
+later return that value, without knowing what data type the function
+tried to return (as long as your caller expects that data type).
+
+`__builtin_apply_args ()'
+     This built-in function returns a pointer of type `void *' to data
+     describing how to perform a call with the same arguments as were
+     passed to the current function.
+
+     The function saves the arg pointer register, structure value
+     address, and all registers that might be used to pass arguments to
+     a function into a block of memory allocated on the stack.  Then it
+     returns the address of that block.
+
+`__builtin_apply (FUNCTION, ARGUMENTS, SIZE)'
+     This built-in function invokes FUNCTION (type `void (*)()') with a
+     copy of the parameters described by ARGUMENTS (type `void *') and
+     SIZE (type `int').
+
+     The value of ARGUMENTS should be the value returned by
+     `__builtin_apply_args'.  The argument SIZE specifies the size of
+     the stack argument data, in bytes.
+
+     This function returns a pointer of type `void *' to data describing
+     how to return whatever value was returned by FUNCTION.  The data
+     is saved in a block of memory allocated on the stack.
+
+     It is not always simple to compute the proper value for SIZE.  The
+     value is used by `__builtin_apply' to compute the amount of data
+     that should be pushed on the stack and copied from the incoming
+     argument area.
+
+`__builtin_return (RESULT)'
+     This built-in function returns the value described by RESULT from
+     the containing function.  You should specify, for RESULT, a value
+     returned by `__builtin_apply'.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Naming Types,  Next: Typeof,  Prev: Constructing Calls,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Naming an Expression's Type
+===========================
+
+   You can give a name to the type of an expression using a `typedef'
+declaration with an initializer.  Here is how to define NAME as a type
+name for the type of EXP:
+
+     typedef NAME = EXP;
+
+   This is useful in conjunction with the statements-within-expressions
+feature.  Here is how the two together can be used to define a safe
+"maximum" macro that operates on any arithmetic type:
+
+     #define max(a,b) \
+       ({typedef _ta = (a), _tb = (b);  \
+         _ta _a = (a); _tb _b = (b);     \
+         _a > _b ? _a : _b; })
+
+   The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
+variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within
+the expressions that are substituted for `a' and `b'.  Eventually we
+hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to
+declare variables whose scopes start only after their initializers;
+this will be a more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.
+
+
+File: gcc.info,  Node: Typeof,  Next: Lvalues,  Prev: Naming Types,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Referring to a Type with `typeof'
+=================================
+
+   Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with `typeof'.
+The syntax of using of this keyword looks like `sizeof', but the
+construct acts semantically like a type name defined with `typedef'.
+
+   There are two ways of writing the argument to `typeof': with an
+expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:
+
+     typeof (x[0](1))
+
+This assumes that `x' is an array of functions; the type described is
+that of the values of the functions.
+
+   Here is an example with a typename as the argument:
+
+     typeof (int *)
+
+Here the type described is that of pointers to `int'.
+
+   If you are writing a header file that must work when included in
+ANSI C programs, write `__typeof__' instead of `typeof'.  *Note
+Alternate Keywords::.
+
+   A `typeof'-construct can be used anywhere a typedef name could be
+used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or
+inside of `sizeof' or `typeof'.
+
+   * This declares `y' with the type of what `x' points to.
+
+          typeof (*x) y;
+
+   * This declares `y' as an array of such values.
+
+          typeof (*x) y[4];
+
+   * This declares `y' as an array of pointers to characters:
+
+          typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;
+
+     It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:
+
+          char *y[4];
+
+     To see the meaning of the declaration using `typeof', and why it
+     might be a useful way to write, let's rewrite it with these macros:
+
+          #define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
+          #define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])
+
+     Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:
+
+          array (pointer (char), 4) y;
+
+     Thus, `array (pointer (char), 4)' is the type of arrays of 4
+     pointers to `char'.

+File: gcc.info,  Node: Lvalues,  Next: Conditionals,  Prev: Typeof,  Up: C Extensions
+
+Generalized Lvalues
+===================
+
+   Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed
+as lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you
+can take their addresses or store values into them.
+
+   Standard C++ allows compound expressions and conditional expressions
+as lvalues, and permits casts to reference type, so use of this
+extension is deprecated for C++ code.
+
+   For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
+expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
+equivalent:
+
+     (a, b) += 5
+     a, (b += 5)
+
+   Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.
+These two expressions are equivalent:
+
+     &(a, b)
+     a, &b
+
+   A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void
+and the true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example,
+these two expressions are equivalent:
+
+     (a ? b : c) = 5
+     (a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
+
+   A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
+assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
+right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
+inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
+converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
+assignment.  Thus, if `a' has type `char *', the following two
+expressions are equivalent:
+
+     (int)a = 5
+     (int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
+
+   An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as `+=' applied to a
+cast performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast,
+and then continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two
+expressions are equivalent:
+
+     (int)a += 5
+     (int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
+
+   You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
+address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that `&(int)f' were
+permitted, where `f' has type `float'.  Then the following statement
+would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating point number
+belongs:
+
+     *&(int)f = 1;
+
+   This is quite different from what `(int)f = 1' would do--that would
+convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
+inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of `&' on a cast.
+
+   If you really do want an `int *' pointer with the address of `f',
+you can simply write `(int *)&f'.

+
+Conditionals with Omitted Operands
+==================================
+
+   The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then
+if the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the
+conditional expression.
+
+   Therefore, the expression
+
+     x ? : y
+
+has the value of `x' if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of `y'.
+
+   This example is perfectly equivalent to
+
+     x ? x : y
+
+In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
+especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand
+does, or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then
+repeating the operand in the middle would perform the side effect
+twice.  Omitting the middle operand uses the value already computed
+without the undesirable effects of recomputing it.

+
+Double-Word Integers
+====================
+
+   GNU C supports data types for integers that are twice as long as
+`int'.  Simply write `long long int' for a signed integer, or `unsigned
+long long int' for an unsigned integer.  To make an integer constant of
+type `long long int', add the suffix `LL' to the integer.  To make an
+integer constant of type `unsigned long long int', add the suffix `ULL'
+to the integer.
+
+   You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types.
+Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types
+are open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded
+if the machine supports fullword-to-doubleword a widening multiply
+instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
+provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
+special library routines that come with GNU CC.
+
+   There may be pitfalls when you use `long long' types for function
+arguments, unless you declare function prototypes.  If a function
+expects type `int' for its argument, and you pass a value of type `long
+long int', confusion will result because the caller and the subroutine
+will disagree about the number of bytes for the argument.  Likewise, if
+the function expects `long long int' and you pass `int'.  The best way
+to avoid such problems is to use prototypes.

+
+Complex Numbers
+===============
+
+   GNU C supports complex data types.  You can declare both complex
+integer types and complex floating types, using the keyword
+`__complex__'.
+
+   For example, `__complex__ double x;' declares `x' as a variable
+whose real part and imaginary part are both of type `double'.
+`__complex__ short int y;' declares `y' to have real and imaginary
+parts of type `short int'; this is not likely to be useful, but it
+shows that the set of complex types is complete.
+
+   To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix `i' or
+`j' (either one; they are equivalent).  For example, `2.5fi' has type
+`__complex__ float' and `3i' has type `__complex__ int'.  Such a
+constant always has a pure imaginary value, but you can form any
+complex value you like by adding one to a real constant.
+
+   To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression EXP, write
+`__real__ EXP'.  Likewise, use `__imag__' to extract the imaginary part.
+
+   The operator `~' performs complex conjugation when used on a value
+with a complex type.
+
+   GNU CC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
+fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
+the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice-versa).  None of the
+supported debugging info formats has a way to represent noncontiguous
+allocation like this, so GNU CC describes a noncontiguous complex
+variable as if it were two separate variables of noncomplex type.  If
+the variable's actual name is `foo', the two fictitious variables are
+named `foo$real' and `foo$imag'.  You can examine and set these two
+fictitious variables with your debugger.
+
+   A future version of GDB will know how to recognize such pairs and
+treat them as a single variable with a complex type.

+
+Hex Floats
+==========
+
+   GNU CC recognizes floating-point numbers written not only in the
+usual decimal notation, such as `1.55e1', but also numbers such as
+`0x1.fp3' written in hexadecimal format.  In that format the `0x' hex
+introducer and the `p' or `P' exponent field are mandatory.  The
+exponent is a decimal number that indicates the power of 2 by which the
+significand part will be multiplied.  Thus `0x1.f' is 1 15/16, `p3'
+multiplies it by 8, and the value of `0x1.fp3' is the same as `1.55e1'.
+
+   Unlike for floating-point numbers in the decimal notation the
+exponent is always required in the hexadecimal notation.  Otherwise the
+compiler would not be able to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g., `0x1.f'.
+This could mean `1.0f' or `1.9375' since `f' is also the extension for
+floating-point constants of type `float'.

+
+Arrays of Length Zero
+=====================
+
+   Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as
+the last element of a structure which is really a header for a
+variable-length object:
+
+     struct line {
+       int length;
+       char contents[0];
+     };
+     
+     {
+       struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
+         malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
+       thisline->length = this_length;
+     }
+
+   In standard C, you would have to give `contents' a length of 1, which
+means either you waste space or complicate the argument to `malloc'.

+This README file is copied into the directory for GCC-only header files
+when fixincludes is run by the makefile for GCC.
+
+Many of the files in this directory were made from the standard system
+header files of this system by the shell script `fixincludes'.
+They are system-specific, and will not work on any other kind of system.
+They are also not part of GCC.  The reason for making the files here
+is to fix the places in the header files which use constructs
+that are incompatible with ANSI C.

+ * 	Varargs for PYR/GNU CC
+ *
+ * WARNING -- WARNING -- DANGER
+ *
+ * The code in this file implements varargs for gcc on a pyr in
+ * a way that is compatible with code compiled by the Pyramid Technology
+ * C compiler.
+ * As such, it depends strongly on the Pyramid conventions for
+ * parameter passing.ct and independent implementation. 
+ * These (somewhat bizarre) parameter-passing conventions are described
+ * in the ``OSx Operating System Porting Guide''.
+ * 
+ * A quick summary is useful:
+ * 12 of the 48 register-windowed regs available for
+ * parameter passing.  Parameters of a function call that are eligible
+ * to be passed in registers are assigned registers from TR0/PR0 onwards;
+ * all other arguments are passed on the stack.
+ * Structure and union parameters are *never* passed in registers,
+ * even if they are small enough to fit.  They are always passed on
+ * the stack.
+ *
+ * Double-sized parameters cannot be passed in TR11, because
+ * TR12 is not used for passing parameters.  If, in the absence of this
+ * rule, a double-sized param would have been passed in TR11,
+ * that parameter is passed on the stack and no parameters are
+ * passed in TR11.
+ * 
+ * It is only known to work for passing 32-bit integer quantities
+ * (ie chars, shorts, ints/enums, longs), doubles, or pointers. 
+ * Passing structures on a Pyramid via varargs is a loser.
+ * Passing an object larger than 8 bytes on a pyramid via varargs may
+ * also be a loser.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The C preprocessor is a \c
+.I macro processor\c
+\& that is used automatically by
+the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.  It is
+called a macro processor because it allows you to define \c
+.I macros\c
+\&,
+which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.
+
+The C preprocessor provides four separate facilities that you can use as
+you see fit:
+.TP
+\(bu
+Inclusion of header files.  These are files of declarations that can be
+substituted into your program.
+.TP
+\(bu
+Macro expansion.  You can define \c
+.I macros\c
+\&, which are abbreviations
+for arbitrary fragments of C code, and then the C preprocessor will
+replace the macros with their definitions throughout the program.
+.TP
+\(bu
+Conditional compilation.  Using special preprocessing directives, you
+can include or exclude parts of the program according to various
+conditions.
+.TP
+\(bu
+Line control.  If you use a program to combine or rearrange source files into
+an intermediate file which is then compiled, you can use line control
+to inform the compiler of where each source line originally came from.
+.PP
+C preprocessors vary in some details.  For a full explanation of the
+GNU C preprocessor, see the
+.B info
+file `\|\c
+.B cpp.info\c
+\&\|', or the manual
+.I The C Preprocessor\c
+\&.  Both of these are built from the same documentation source file, `\|\c
+.B cpp.texinfo\c
+\&\|'.  The GNU C
+preprocessor provides a superset of the features of ANSI Standard C.
+
+ANSI Standard C requires the rejection of many harmless constructs commonly
+used by today's C programs.  Such incompatibility would be inconvenient for
+users, so the GNU C preprocessor is configured to accept these constructs
+by default.  Strictly speaking, to get ANSI Standard C, you must use the
+options `\|\c
+.B \-trigraphs\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B \-undef\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-pedantic\c
+\&\|', but in
+practice the consequences of having strict ANSI Standard C make it
+undesirable to do this.  
+
+Most often when you use the C preprocessor you will not have to invoke it
+explicitly: the C compiler will do so automatically.  However, the
+preprocessor is sometimes useful individually.
+
+When you call the preprocessor individually, either name
+(\c
+.B cpp\c
+\& or \c
+.B cccp\c
+\&) will do\(em\&they are completely synonymous.
+
+The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments, \c
+.I infile\c
+\& and
+\c
+.I outfile\c
+\&.  The preprocessor reads \c
+.I infile\c
+\& together with any other
+files it specifies with `\|\c
+.B #include\c
+\&\|'.  All the output generated by the
+combined input files is written in \c
+.I outfile\c
+\&.
+
+Either \c
+.I infile\c
+\& or \c
+.I outfile\c
+\& may be `\|\c
+.B \-\c
+\&\|', which as \c
+.I infile\c
+\&
+means to read from standard input and as \c
+.I outfile\c
+\& means to write to
+standard output.  Also, if \c
+.I outfile\c
+\& or both file names are omitted,
+the standard output and standard input are used for the omitted file names.
+.SH OPTIONS
+Here is a table of command options accepted by the C preprocessor.  
+These options can also be given when compiling a C program; they are
+passed along automatically to the preprocessor when it is invoked by
+the compiler. 
+.TP
+.B \-P
+Inhibit generation of `\|\c
+.B #\c
+\&\|'-lines with line-number information in
+the output from the preprocessor.  This might be
+useful when running the preprocessor on something that is not C code
+and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
+`\|\c
+.B #\c
+\&\|'-lines.
+.TP
+.B \-C
+Do not discard comments: pass them through to the output file.
+Comments appearing in arguments of a macro call will be copied to the
+output before the expansion of the macro call.
+.TP
+.B \-traditional
+Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C, as opposed to ANSI C.
+.TP
+.B \-trigraphs
+Process ANSI standard trigraph sequences.  These are three-character
+sequences, all starting with `\|\c
+.B ??\c
+\&\|', that are defined by ANSI C to
+stand for single characters.  For example, `\|\c
+.B ??/\c
+\&\|' stands for
+`\|\c
+.BR "\e" "\|',"
+so `\|\c
+.B '??/n'\c
+\&\|' is a character constant for a newline.
+Strictly speaking, the GNU C preprocessor does not support all
+programs in ANSI Standard C unless `\|\c
+.B \-trigraphs\c
+\&\|' is used, but if
+you ever notice the difference it will be with relief.
+
+You don't want to know any more about trigraphs.
+.TP
+.B \-pedantic
+Issue warnings required by the ANSI C standard in certain cases such
+as when text other than a comment follows `\|\c
+.B #else\c
+\&\|' or `\|\c
+.B #endif\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-pedantic\-errors
+Like `\|\c
+.B \-pedantic\c
+\&\|', except that errors are produced rather than
+warnings.
+.TP
+.B \-Wtrigraphs
+Warn if any trigraphs are encountered (assuming they are enabled).
+.TP
+.B \-Wcomment
+.TP
+.B \-Wcomments
+Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `\|\c
+.B /*\c
+\&\|' appears in a comment.
+(Both forms have the same effect).
+.TP
+.B \-Wall
+Requests both `\|\c
+.B \-Wtrigraphs\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-Wcomment\c
+\&\|' (but not
+`\|\c
+.B \-Wtraditional\c
+\&\|'). 
+.TP
+.B \-Wtraditional
+Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
+ANSI C.
+.TP
+.BI "\-I " directory\c
+\&
+Add the directory \c
+.I directory\c
+\& to the end of the list of
+directories to be searched for header files.
+This can be used to override a system header file, substituting your
+own version, since these directories are searched before the system
+header file directories.  If you use more than one `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' option,
+the directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard
+system directories come after.
+.TP
+.B \-I\-
+Any directories specified with `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' options before the `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|'
+option are searched only for the case of `\|\c
+.B #include "\c
+.I file\c
+\&"\c
+\&\|';
+they are not searched for `\|\c
+.B #include <\c
+.I file\c
+\&>\c
+\&\|'.
+
+If additional directories are specified with `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' options after
+the `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|', these directories are searched for all `\|\c
+.B #include\c
+\&\|'
+directives.
+
+In addition, the `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|' option inhibits the use of the current
+directory as the first search directory for `\|\c
+.B #include "\c
+.I file\c
+\&"\c
+\&\|'.
+Therefore, the current directory is searched only if it is requested
+explicitly with `\|\c
+.B \-I.\c
+\&\|'.  Specifying both `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-I.\c
+\&\|'
+allows you to control precisely which directories are searched before
+the current one and which are searched after.
+.TP
+.B \-nostdinc
+Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
+Only the directories you have specified with `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' options
+(and the current directory, if appropriate) are searched.
+.TP
+.B \-nostdinc++
+Do not search for header files in the C++ specific standard
+directories, but do still search the other standard directories.
+(This option is used when building libg++.)
+.TP
+.BI "\-D " "name"\c
+\&
+Predefine \c
+.I name\c
+\& as a macro, with definition `\|\c
+.B 1\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.BI "\-D " "name" = definition
+\&
+Predefine \c
+.I name\c
+\& as a macro, with definition \c
+.I definition\c
+\&.
+There are no restrictions on the contents of \c
+.I definition\c
+\&, but if
+you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program
+you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters
+such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.  If you use more than
+one `\|\c
+.B \-D\c
+\&\|' for the same
+.I name\c
+\&, the rightmost definition takes effect.
+.TP
+.BI "\-U " "name"\c
+\&
+Do not predefine \c
+.I name\c
+\&.  If both `\|\c
+.B \-U\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-D\c
+\&\|' are
+specified for one name, the `\|\c
+.B \-U\c
+\&\|' beats the `\|\c
+.B \-D\c
+\&\|' and the name
+is not predefined.
+.TP
+.B \-undef
+Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.
+.TP
+.BI "\-A " "name(" value )
+Assert (in the same way as the \c
+.B #assert\c
+\& directive)
+the predicate \c
+.I name\c
+\& with tokenlist \c
+.I value\c
+\&.  Remember to escape or quote the parentheses on
+shell command lines.
+
+You can use `\|\c
+.B \-A-\c
+\&\|' to disable all predefined assertions; it also
+undefines all predefined macros.
+.TP
+.B \-dM
+Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a list of
+`\|\c
+.B #define\c
+\&\|' directives for all the macros defined during the
+execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives

+\c
+.B addr2line
+translates program addresses into file names and line numbers.  Given
+an address and an executable, it uses the debugging information in the
+executable to figure out which file name and line number are
+associated with a given address.
+
+The executable to use is specified with the
+.B \-e
+option.  The default is
+.B a.out\c
+\&.
+
+.B addr2line
+has two modes of operation.
+
+In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command line,
+and
+.B addr2line
+displays the file name and line number for each address.
+
+In the second,
+.B addr2line
+reads hexadecimal addresses from standard input, and prints the file
+name and line number for each address on standard output.  In this
+mode,
+.B addr2line
+may be used in a pipe to convert dynamically chosen addresses.
+
+The format of the output is FILENAME:LINENO.  The file name and line
+number for each address is printed on a separate line.  If the
+.B \-f
+option is used, then each FILENAME:LINENO line is preceded by a
+FUNCTIONNAME line which is the name of the function containing the
+address.
+
+If the file name or function name can not be determined,
+.B addr2line
+will print two question marks in their place.  If the line number can
+not be determined,

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The GNU \c
+.B ar\c
+\& program creates, modifies, and extracts from
+archives.  An \c
+.I archive\c
+\& is a single file holding a collection of
+other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve
+the original individual files (called \c
+.I members\c
+\& of the archive).
+
+The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and
+group are preserved in the archive, and may be reconstituted on
+extraction.  
+
+GNU \c
+.B ar\c
+\& can maintain archives whose members have names of any
+length; however, depending on how \c
+.B ar\c
+\& is configured on your
+system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed (for compatibility
+with archive formats maintained with other tools).  If it exists, the
+limit is often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16
+characters (typical of formats related to coff).
+
+\c
+.B ar\c
+\& is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort
+are most often used as \c
+.I libraries\c
+\& holding commonly needed
+subroutines.
+
+\c
+.B ar\c
+\& will create an index to the symbols defined in relocatable
+object modules in the archive when you specify the modifier `\|\c
+.B s\c
+\|'.
+Once created, this index is updated in the archive whenever \c
+.B ar\c
+\&
+makes a change to its contents (save for the `\|\c
+.B q\c
+\|' update operation).
+An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and
+allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
+their placement in the archive.
+
+You may use `\|\c
+.B nm \-s\c
+\|' or `\|\c
+.B nm \-\-print\-armap\c
+\|' to list this index
+table.  If an archive lacks the table, another form of \c
+.B ar\c
+\& called
+\c
+.B ranlib\c
+\& can be used to add just the table.
+
+\c
+.B ar\c
+\& insists on at least two arguments to execute: one
+keyletter specifying the \c
+.I operation\c
+\& (optionally accompanied by other
+keyletters specifying \c
+.I modifiers\c
+\&), and the archive name to act on.
+
+Most operations can also accept further \c
+.I files\c
+\& arguments,
+specifying particular files to operate on.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+GNU \c
+.B ar\c
+\& allows you to mix the operation code \c
+.I p\c
+\& and modifier
+flags \c
+.I mod\c
+\& in any order, within the first command-line argument.
+
+If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
+dash.
+
+The \c
+.I p\c
+\& keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be
+any of the following, but you must specify only one of them:
+
+.TP
+.B d
+\c
+.I Delete\c
+\& modules from the archive.  Specify the names of modules to
+be deleted as \c
+.I files\c
+\&; the archive is untouched if you
+specify no files to delete.
+
+If you specify the `\|\c
+.B v\c
+\|' modifier, \c
+.B ar\c
+\& will list each module
+as it is deleted.
+
+.TP
+.B m
+Use this operation to \c
+.I move\c
+\& members in an archive.
+
+The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how
+programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in more
+than one member.  
+
+If no modifiers are used with \c
+.B m\c
+\&, any members you name in the
+\c
+.I files\c
+\& arguments are moved to the \c
+.I end\c
+\& of the archive;
+you can use the `\|\c
+.B a\c
+\|', `\|\c
+.B b\c
+\|', or `\|\c
+.B i\c
+\|' modifiers to move them to a
+specified place instead.
+
+.TP
+.B p
+\c
+.I Print\c
+\& the specified members of the archive, to the standard
+output file.  If the `\|\c
+.B v\c
+\|' modifier is specified, show the member
+name before copying its contents to standard output.
+
+If you specify no \c
+.I files\c
+\&, all the files in the archive are printed.
+
+.TP
+.B q
+\c
+.I Quick append\c
+\&; add \c
+.I files\c
+\& to the end of \c
+.I archive\c
+\&,
+without checking for replacement.  
+
+The modifiers `\|\c
+.B a\c
+\|', `\|\c
+.B b\c
+\|', and `\|\c
+.B i\c
+\|' do \c
+.I not\c
+\& affect this
+operation; new members are always placed at the end of the archive.
+
+The modifier `\|\c
+.B v\c
+\|' makes \c
+.B ar\c
+\& list each file as it is appended.
+
+Since the point of this operation is speed, the archive's symbol table
+index is not updated, even if it already existed; you can use `\|\c
+.B ar s\c
+\|' or
+\c
+.B ranlib\c
+\& explicitly to update the symbol table index.
+
+However, too many different systems assume quick append rebuilds the
+index, so GNU
+.B ar
+implements `\|\c
+.B q\c
+\|' as a synonym for `\|\c
+.B r\c
+\|'.
+
+.TP
+.B r
+Insert \c
+.I files\c
+\& into \c
+.I archive\c
+\& (with \c
+.I replacement\c
+\&). This
+operation differs from `\|\c
+.B q\c
+\|' in that any previously existing members
+are deleted if their names match those being added.
+
+If one of the files named in \c
+.I files\c
+\& doesn't exist, \c
+.B ar\c
+\&
+displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing members
+of the archive matching that name.
+
+By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may
+use one of the modifiers `\|\c
+.B a\c
+\|', `\|\c
+.B b\c
+\|', or `\|\c
+.B i\c
+\|' to request
+placement relative to some existing member.
+
+The modifier `\|\c
+.B v\c
+\|' used with this operation elicits a line of
+output for each file inserted, along with one of the letters `\|\c
+.B a\c
+\|' or
+`\|\c
+.B r\c
+\|' to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member
+deleted) or replaced.
+
+.TP
+.B t
+Display a \c
+.I table\c
+\& listing the contents of \c
+.I archive\c
+\&, or those
+of the files listed in \c
+.I files\c
+\& that are present in the
+archive.  Normally only the member name is shown; if you also want to
+see the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size, you can
+request that by also specifying the `\|\c
+.B v\c
+\|' modifier.
+
+If you do not specify any \c
+.I files\c
+\&, all files in the archive
+are listed.
+
+If there is more than one file with the same name (say, `\|\c
+.B fie\c
+\|') in
+an archive (say `\|\c
+.B b.a\c
+\|'), `\|\c
+.B ar t b.a fie\c
+\|' will list only the
+first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete
+listing\(em\&in our example, `\|\c
+.B ar t b.a\c
+\|'.
+
+.TP
+.B x
+\c
+.I Extract\c
+\& members (named \c
+.I files\c
+\&) from the archive.  You can
+use the `\|\c
+.B v\c
+\|' modifier with this operation, to request that
+\c
+.B ar\c
+\& list each name as it extracts it.
+
+If you do not specify any \c
+.I files\c
+\&, all files in the archive
+are extracted.
+
+.PP
+
+A number of modifiers (\c
+.I mod\c
+\&) may immediately follow the \c
+.I p\c
+\&
+keyletter, to specify variations on an operation's behavior:
+
+.TP
+.B a
+Add new files \c
+.I after\c
+\& an existing member of the
+archive.  If you use the modifier \c
+.B a\c
+\&, the name of an existing archive
+member must be present as the \c
+.I membername\c
+\& argument, before the
+\c
+.I archive\c
+\& specification.
+
+.TP
+.B b
+Add new files \c
+.I before\c
+\& an existing member of the
+archive.  If you use the modifier \c
+.B b\c
+\&, the name of an existing archive
+member must be present as the \c
+.I membername\c
+\& argument, before the
+\c
+.I archive\c
+\& specification.  (same as `\|\c
+.B i\c
+\|').
+
+.TP
+.B c
+\c
+.I Create\c
+\& the archive.  The specified \c
+.I archive\c
+\& is always
+created if it didn't exist, when you request an update.  But a warning is
+issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by
+using this modifier.
+
+.TP
+.B f
+Truncate names in the archive.  
+.B ar
+will normally permit file names of any length.  This will cause it to
+create archives which are not compatible with the native 
+.B ar
+program on some systems.  If this is a concern, the 
+.B f
+modifier may be used to truncate file names when putting them in the
+archive.
+
+.TP
+.B i
+Insert new files \c
+.I before\c
+\& an existing member of the
+archive.  If you use the modifier \c
+.B i\c
+\&, the name of an existing archive
+member must be present as the \c
+.I membername\c
+\& argument, before the
+\c
+.I archive\c
+\& specification.  (same as `\|\c
+.B b\c
+\|').
+
+.TP
+.B l
+This modifier is accepted but not used.
+
+.TP
+.B N
+Uses the
+.I count
+parameter.  This is used if there are multiple entries in the archive
+with the same name.  Extract or delete instance
+.I count
+of the given name from the archive.
+
+.TP
+.B o
+Preserve the \c
+.I original\c
+\& dates of members when extracting them.  If
+you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive
+will be stamped with the time of extraction.
+
+.TP
+.B P
+Use the full path name when matching names in the archive.
+.B ar
+can not create an archive with a full path name (such archives are not
+POSIX complaint), but other archive creators can.  This option will
+cause
+.B ar
+to match file names using a complete path name, which can be
+convenient when extracting a single file from an archive created by
+another tool.
+
+.TP
+.B s
+Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one,
+even if no other change is made to the archive.  You may use this modifier
+flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running `\|\c
+.B ar s\c
+\|' on an
+archive is equivalent to running `\|\c
+.B ranlib\c
+\|' on it.
+
+.TP
+.B S
+Do not generate an archive symbol table.  This can speed up building a
+large library in several steps.  The resulting archive can not be used
+with the linker.  In order to build a symbol table, you must omit the
+`\|\c
+.B S\c
+\|' modifier on the last execution of `\|\c
+.B ar\c
+\|', or you must run `\|\c
+.B ranlib\c
+\|' on the archive.
+
+.TP
+.B u
+Normally, \c
+.B ar r\c
+\&.\|.\|. inserts all files
+listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert \c
+.I only\c
+\& those
+of the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same
+names, use this modifier.  The `\|\c
+.B u\c
+\|' modifier is allowed only for the
+operation `\|\c
+.B r\c
+\|' (replace).  In particular, the combination `\|\c
+.B qu\c
+\|' is
+not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed
+advantage from the operation `\|\c
+.B q\c
+\|'.
+
+.TP
+.B v
+This modifier requests the \c
+.I verbose\c
+\& version of an operation.  Many
+operations display additional information, such as filenames processed,
+when the modifier `\|\c
+.B v\c
+\|' is appended.
+

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+GNU \c
+.B as\c
+\& is really a family of assemblers.  
+If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you
+should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
+architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
+including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
+\c
+.I pseudo-ops)\c
+\& and assembler syntax.  
+
+For information on the syntax and pseudo-ops used by GNU \c
+.B as\c
+\&, see `\|\c
+.B as\c
+\|' entry in \c
+.B info \c
+(or the manual \c
+.I
+.I
+Using as: The GNU Assembler\c
+\&).
+
+\c
+.B as\c
+\& is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C
+compiler \c
+.B gcc\c
+\& for use by the linker \c
+.B ld\c
+\&.  Nevertheless,
+we've tried to make \c
+.B as\c
+\& assemble correctly everything that the native
+assembler would.
+This doesn't mean \c
+.B as\c
+\& always uses the same syntax as another
+assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
+incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.
+
+Each time you run \c
+.B as\c
+\& it assembles exactly one source
+program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
+(The standard input is also a file.)
+
+If \c
+.B as\c
+\& is given no file names it attempts to read one input file
+from the \c
+.B as\c
+\& standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
+may have to type \c
+.B ctl-D\c
+\& to tell \c
+.B as\c
+\& there is no more program
+to assemble.  Use `\|\c
+.B \-\^\-\c
+\|' if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
+in your command line.
+
+.B as\c
+\& may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
+file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when \c
+.B as\c
+\& is
+run automatically by a compiler.  Warnings report an assumption made so
+that \c
+.B as\c
+\& could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a
+grave problem that stops the assembly.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.BR \-a
+Turn on assembly listings.  There are various suboptions.
+.B d
+omits debugging directives.
+.B h
+includes the high level source code; this is only available if the
+source file can be found, and the code was compiled with
+.B \-g.
+.B l
+includes an assembly listing.
+.B n
+omits forms processing.
+.B s
+includes a symbol listing.
+.B =
+.I file
+sets the listing file name; this must be the last suboption.
+The default suboptions are
+.B hls.
+.TP
+.B \-D
+This option is accepted only for script compatibility with calls to
+other assemblers; it has no effect on \c
+.B as\c
+\&.
+.TP
+.B \-\-defsym SYM=VALUE
+Define the symbol SYM to be VALUE before assembling the input file.
+VALUE must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading 0x indicates a
+hexadecimal value, and a leading 0 indicates an octal value.
+.TP
+.B \-f
+``fast''--skip preprocessing (assume source is compiler output).
+.TP
+.BI "\-I\ " path
+Add 
+.I path
+to the search list for 
+.B .include
+directives.
+.TP
+.B \-\-gstabs
+Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.  This
+may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.
+.TP
+.B \-K
+Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long displacements.
+.TP
+.B \-L
+Keep (in symbol table) local symbols, starting with `\|\c
+.B L\c
+\|'
+.TP
+.B \-M, \-\-mri
+Assemble in MRI compatibility mode.
+.TP
+.BI "\-o\ " objfile
+Name the object-file output from \c
+.B as
+.TP
+.B \-R
+Fold data section into text section
+.TP
+.B \-\-traditional\-format
+Use same format as native assembler, when possible.
+.TP
+.B \-v
+Announce \c
+.B as\c
+\& version
+.TP
+.B \-W, \-\-no-warn
+Suppress warning messages.
+.TP
+.B \-\-fatal\-warnings
+Consider warnings to be fatal.
+.TP
+.B \-\-warn
+Just warn on warnings.
+.TP
+.IR "\-\^\-" "\ |\ " "files\|.\|.\|."
+Source files to assemble, or standard input (\c
+.BR "\-\^\-" ")"
+.TP
+.BI \-A var
+.I

+Specify which variant of the 960 architecture is the target.
+.TP
+.B \-b
+.I
+(When configured for Intel 960.)
+Add code to collect statistics about branches taken.
+.TP
+.B \-no-relax
+.I
+(When configured for Intel 960.)
+Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long displacements;
+error if necessary.
+.TP
+.B \-l
+.I
+(When configured for Motorola 68000).  
+.br
+Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.
+.TP
+.BR "\-mc68000" "\||\|" "\-mc68010" "\||\|" "\-mc68020"
+.I
+(When configured for Motorola 68000).  
+.br
+Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target (default 68020)
+
+.PP
+Options may be in any order, and may be
+before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
+significant.
+
+`\|\c
+.B \-\^\-\c
+\|' (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
+explicitly, as one of the files for \c
+.B as\c
+\& to assemble.
+
+Except for `\|\c
+.B \-\^\-\c
+\|' any command line argument that begins with a
+hyphen (`\|\c
+.B \-\c
+\|') is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of
+\c
+.B as\c
+\&.  No option changes the way another option works.  An
+option is a `\|\c
+.B \-\c
+\|' followed by one or more letters; the case of
+the letter is important.   All options are optional.
+
+The `\|\c
+.B \-o\c
+\|' option expects exactly one file name to follow.  The file
+name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible
+with older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
+standard).  
+
+These two command lines are equivalent:
+.br
+.B
+as\ \ \-o\ \ my\-object\-file.o\ \ mumble.s
+.br
+.B
+as\ \ \-omy\-object\-file.o\ \ mumble.s

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The C++ language provides function overloading, which means that you can
+write many functions with the same name (providing each takes parameters
+of different types).  All C++ function names are encoded into a
+low-level assembly label (this process is known as
+.I mangling\c
+).  The 
+.B c++filt
+program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (\fIdemangles\fR)
+low-level names into user-level names so that the linker can keep
+these overloaded functions from clashing.
+.PP
+Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores,
+dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential label.  If the
+label decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name replaces the low-level
+name in the output.
+.PP
+You can use
+.B c++filt
+to decipher individual symbols by specifying these symbols on the
+command line.
+.PP
+If no
+.B symbol
+arguments are given,
+.B c++filt
+reads symbol names from the standard input and writes the demangled
+names to the standard output.  All results are printed on the standard
+output.
+.SH OPTIONS

+On some systems, both the C and C++ compilers put an

+This option removes the leading underscore.

+.SH WARNING
+The information in this man page is an extract from the full
+documentation of the GNU C compiler, and is limited to the meaning of
+the options.
+.PP
+This man page is not kept up to date except when volunteers want to
+maintain it.  If you find a discrepancy between the man page and the
+software, please check the Info file, which is the authoritative
+documentation.
+.PP
+If we find that the things in this man page that are out of date cause
+significant confusion or complaints, we will stop distributing the man
+page.  The alternative, updating the man page when we update the Info
+file, is impossible because the rest of the work of maintaining GNU CC
+leaves us no time for that.  The GNU project regards man pages as
+obsolete and should not let them take time away from other things.
+.PP
+For complete and current documentation, refer to the Info file `\|\c
+.B gcc\c
+\&\|' or the manual
+.I
+Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0)\c
+\&.  Both are made from the Texinfo source file
+.BR gcc.texinfo .
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The C and C++ compilers are integrated.  Both process input files
+through one or more of four stages: preprocessing, compilation,
+assembly, and linking.  Source filename suffixes identify the source
+language, but which name you use for the compiler governs default
+assumptions:
+.TP
+.B gcc
+assumes preprocessed (\c
+.B .i\c
+\&) files are C and assumes C style linking.
+.TP
+.B g++
+assumes preprocessed (\c
+.B .i\c
+\&) files are C++ and assumes C++ style linking.
+.PP
+Suffixes of source file names indicate the language and kind of
+processing to be done:
+.Sp
+.nf
+.ta \w'\fB.cxx\fP  'u
+\&\fB.c\fP	C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
+\&\fB.C\fP	C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
+\&\fB.cc\fP	C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
+\&\fB.cxx\fP	C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
+\&\fB.m\fP	Objective-C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
+\&\fB.i\fP	preprocessed C; compile, assemble
+\&\fB.ii\fP	preprocessed C++; compile, assemble
+\&\fB.s\fP	Assembler source; assemble
+\&\fB.S\fP	Assembler source; preprocess, assemble
+\&\fB.h\fP	Preprocessor file; not usually named on command line
+.Sp
+.fi
+Files with other suffixes are passed to the linker.  Common cases include:
+.Sp
+.nf
+\&\fB.o\fP	Object file
+\&\fB.a\fP	Archive file
+.br
+.fi
+.Sp
+Linking is always the last stage unless you use one of the
+.BR \-c ,
+.BR \-S ,
+or
+.B \-E
+options to avoid it (or unless compilation errors stop the whole
+process).  For the link stage, all
+.B .o
+files corresponding to source files,
+.B \-l
+libraries, unrecognized filenames (including named
+.B .o
+object files and
+.B .a
+archives)
+are passed to the linker in command-line order.
+.SH OPTIONS
+Options must be separate: `\|\c
+.B \-dr\c
+\&\|' is quite different from `\|\c
+.B \-d \-r
+\&\|'.
+.PP
+Most `\|\c
+.B \-f\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-W\c
+\&\|' options have two contrary forms:
+.BI \-f name
+and
+.BI \-fno\- name\c
+\& (or
+.BI \-W name
+and
+.BI \-Wno\- name\c

+.SH OVERALL OPTIONS
+.TP
+.BI "\-x " "language"
+Specify explicitly the
+.I language\c
+\& for the following input files (rather than choosing a default based
+on the file name suffix) .  This option applies to all following input
+files until the next `\|\c
+.B \-x\c
+\&\|' option.  Possible values of \c
+.I language\c
+\& are
+`\|\c
+.B c\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B objective\-c\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B c\-header\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B c++\c
+\&\|',
+`\|\c
+.B cpp\-output\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B assembler\c
+\&\|', and `\|\c
+.B assembler\-with\-cpp\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-x none
+Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
+handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if `\|\c
+.B \-x\c
+\&\|'
+has not been used at all).
+.PP
+If you want only some of the four stages (preprocess, compile,
+assemble, link), you can use
+`\|\c
+.B \-x\c
+\&\|' (or filename suffixes) to tell \c
+.B gcc\c
+\& where to start, and
+one of the options `\|\c
+.B \-c\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B \-S\c
+\&\|', or `\|\c
+.B \-E\c
+\&\|' to say where
+.B gcc\c
+\& is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
+`\|\c
+.B \-x cpp\-output \-E\c
+\&\|') instruct \c
+.B gcc\c
+\& to do nothing at all.
+.TP
+.B \-c
+Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The compiler
+output is an object file corresponding to each source file.
+.Sp
+By default, GCC makes the object file name for a source file by replacing
+the suffix `\|\c
+.B .c\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B .i\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B .s\c
+\&\|', etc., with `\|\c
+.B .o\c
+\&\|'.  Use
+.B \-o\c
+\& to select another name.
+.Sp
+GCC ignores any unrecognized input files (those that do not require
+compilation or assembly) with the
+.B \-c
+option.
+.TP
+.B \-S
+Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
+is an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
+file specified.
+.Sp
+By default, GCC makes the assembler file name for a source file by
+replacing the suffix `\|\c
+.B .c\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B .i\c
+\&\|', etc., with `\|\c
+.B .s\c
+\&\|'.  Use
+.B \-o\c
+\& to select another name.
+.Sp
+GCC ignores any input files that don't require compilation.
+.TP
+.B \-E
+Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
+output is preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
+standard output.
+.Sp
+GCC ignores input files which don't require preprocessing.
+.TP
+.BI "\-o " file
+Place output in file \c
+.I file\c
+\&.  This applies regardless to whatever
+sort of output GCC is producing, whether it be an executable file,
+an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
+.Sp
+Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
+use `\|\c
+.B \-o\c
+\&\|' when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
+producing an executable file as output.
+.Sp
+If you do not specify `\|\c
+.B \-o\c
+\&\|', the default is to put an executable file
+in `\|\c
+.B a.out\c
+\&\|', the object file for `\|\c
+.I source\c
+.B \&.\c
+.I suffix\c
+\&\c
+\&\|' in
+`\|\c
+.I source\c
+.B \&.o\c
+\&\|', its assembler file in `\|\c
+.I source\c
+.B \&.s\c
+\&\|', and
+all preprocessed C source on standard output.
+.TP
+.B \-v
+Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
+of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
+program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
+.TP
+.B \-pipe
+Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
+various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
+the assembler cannot read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
+no trouble.
+.PP
+.SH LANGUAGE OPTIONS
+The following options control the dialect of C that the compiler
+accepts:
+.TP
+.B \-ansi
+Support all ANSI standard C programs.
+.Sp
+This turns off certain features of GNU C that are incompatible with
+ANSI C, such as the \c
+.B asm\c
+\&, \c
+.B inline\c
+\& and \c
+.B typeof
+keywords, and predefined macros such as \c
+.B unix\c
+\& and \c
+.B vax
+that identify the type of system you are using.  It also enables the
+undesirable and rarely used ANSI trigraph feature, and disallows `\|\c
+.B $\c
+\&\|' as part of identifiers.
+.Sp
+The alternate keywords \c
+.B _\|_asm_\|_\c
+\&, \c
+.B _\|_extension_\|_\c
+\&,
+.B _\|_inline_\|_\c
+\& and \c
+.B _\|_typeof_\|_\c
+\& continue to work despite
+`\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|'.  You would not want to use them in an ANSI C program, of
+course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
+in compilations done with `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|'.  Alternate predefined macros
+such as \c
+.B _\|_unix_\|_\c
+\& and \c
+.B _\|_vax_\|_\c
+\& are also available, with or
+without `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|'.
+.Sp
+The `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|' option does not cause non-ANSI programs to be
+rejected gratuitously.  For that, `\|\c
+.B \-pedantic\c
+\&\|' is required in
+addition to `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|'.
+.Sp
+The preprocessor predefines a macro \c
+.B _\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\c
+\& when you use the `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|'
+option.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
+from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
+ANSI standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
+programs that might use these names for other things.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-asm
+Do not recognize \c
+.B asm\c
+\&, \c
+.B inline\c
+\& or \c
+.B typeof\c
+\& as a
+keyword.  These words may then be used as identifiers.  You can
+use \c
+.B _\|_asm_\|_\c
+\&, \c
+.B _\|_inline_\|_\c
+\& and \c
+.B _\|_typeof_\|_\c
+\& instead.
+`\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|' implies `\|\c
+.B \-fno\-asm\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-builtin
+Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with two leading
+underscores.  Currently, the functions affected include \c
+.B _exit\c
+\&,
+.B abort\c
+\&, \c
+.B abs\c
+\&, \c
+.B alloca\c
+\&, \c
+.B cos\c
+\&, \c
+.B exit\c
+\&,
+.B fabs\c
+\&, \c
+.B labs\c
+\&, \c
+.B memcmp\c
+\&, \c
+.B memcpy\c
+\&, \c
+.B sin\c
+\&,
+.B sqrt\c
+\&, \c
+.B strcmp\c
+\&, \c
+.B strcpy\c
+\&, and \c
+.B strlen\c
+\&.
+.Sp
+The `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|' option prevents \c
+.B alloca\c
+\& and \c
+.B _exit\c
+\& from
+being builtin functions.
+.TP
+.B \-fhosted
+Compile for a hosted environment; this implies the `\|\c
+.B \-fbuiltin\c
+\&\|' option, and implies that suspicious declarations of
+.B main\c
+\& should be warned about.
+.TP
+.B \-ffreestanding
+Compile for a freestanding environment; this implies the `\|\c
+.B \-fno-builtin\c
+\&\|' option, and implies that
+.B main\c
+\& has no special requirements.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-strict\-prototype
+Treat a function declaration with no arguments, such as `\|\c
+.B int foo
+();\c
+\&\|', as C would treat it\(em\&as saying nothing about the number of
+arguments or their types (C++ only).  Normally, such a declaration in
+C++ means that the function \c
+.B foo\c
+\& takes no arguments.
+.TP
+.B \-trigraphs
+Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|' option implies `\|\c
+.B \-trigraphs\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-traditional
+Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
+For details, see the GNU C Manual; the duplicate list here
+has been deleted so that we won't get complaints when it
+is out of date.
+.Sp
+But one note about C++ programs only (not C).  `\|\c
+.B \-traditional\c
+\&\|' has one additional effect for C++: assignment to
+.B this
+is permitted.  This is the same as the effect of `\|\c
+.B \-fthis\-is\-variable\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-traditional\-cpp
+Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C preprocessors.
+This includes the items that specifically mention the preprocessor above,
+but none of the other effects of `\|\c
+.B \-traditional\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-fdollars\-in\-identifiers
+Permit the use of `\|\c
+.B $\c
+\&\|' in identifiers (C++ only).  You can also use
+`\|\c
+.B \-fno\-dollars\-in\-identifiers\c
+\&\|' to explicitly prohibit use of
+`\|\c
+.B $\c
+\&\|'.  (GNU C++ allows `\|\c
+.B $\c
+\&\|' by default on some target systems
+but not others.)
+.TP
+.B \-fenum\-int\-equiv
+Permit implicit conversion of \c
+.B int\c
+\& to enumeration types (C++
+only).  Normally GNU C++ allows conversion of \c
+.B enum\c
+\& to \c
+.B int\c
+\&,
+but not the other way around.
+.TP
+.B \-fexternal\-templates
+Produce smaller code for template declarations, by generating only a
+single copy of each template function where it is defined (C++ only).
+To use this option successfully, you must also mark all files that
+use templates with either `\|\c
+.B #pragma implementation\c
+\&\|' (the definition) or
+`\|\c
+.B #pragma interface\c
+\&\|' (declarations).
+
+When your code is compiled with `\|\c
+.B \-fexternal\-templates\c
+\&\|', all
+template instantiations are external.  You must arrange for all
+necessary instantiations to appear in the implementation file; you can
+do this with a \c
+.B typedef\c
+\& that references each instantiation needed.
+Conversely, when you compile using the default option
+`\|\c
+.B \-fno\-external\-templates\c
+\&\|', all template instantiations are
+explicitly internal.
+.TP
+.B \-fall\-virtual
+Treat all possible member functions as virtual, implicitly.  All
+member functions (except for constructor functions and
+.B new
+or
+.B delete
+member operators) are treated as virtual functions of the class where
+they appear.
+.Sp
+This does not mean that all calls to these member functions will be
+made through the internal table of virtual functions.  Under some
+circumstances, the compiler can determine that a call to a given
+virtual function can be made directly; in these cases the calls are
+direct in any case.
+.TP
+.B \-fcond\-mismatch
+Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
+third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.
+.TP
+.B \-fthis\-is\-variable
+Permit assignment to \c
+.B this\c
+\& (C++ only).  The incorporation of
+user-defined free store management into C++ has made assignment to
+`\|\c
+.B this\c
+\&\|' an anachronism.  Therefore, by default it is invalid to
+assign to \c
+.B this\c
+\& within a class member function.  However, for
+backwards compatibility, you can make it valid with
+`\|\c
+.B \-fthis-is-variable\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-funsigned\-char
+Let the type \c
+.B char\c
+\& be unsigned, like \c
+.B unsigned char\c
+\&.
+.Sp
+Each kind of machine has a default for what \c
+.B char\c
+\& should
+be.  It is either like \c
+.B unsigned char\c
+\& by default or like
+.B signed char\c
+\& by default.
+.Sp
+Ideally, a portable program should always use \c
+.B signed char\c
+\& or
+.B unsigned char\c
+\& when it depends on the signedness of an object.
+But many programs have been written to use plain \c
+.B char\c
+\& and
+expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
+machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
+make such a program work with the opposite default.
+.Sp
+The type \c
+.B char\c
+\& is always a distinct type from each of
+.B signed char\c
+\& and \c
+.B unsigned char\c
+\&, even though its behavior
+is always just like one of those two.
+.TP
+.B \-fsigned\-char
+Let the type \c
+.B char\c
+\& be signed, like \c
+.B signed char\c
+\&.
+.Sp
+Note that this is equivalent to `\|\c
+.B \-fno\-unsigned\-char\c
+\&\|', which is
+the negative form of `\|\c
+.B \-funsigned\-char\c
+\&\|'.  Likewise,
+`\|\c
+.B \-fno\-signed\-char\c
+\&\|' is equivalent to `\|\c
+.B \-funsigned\-char\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-fsigned\-bitfields
+.TP
+.B \-funsigned\-bitfields
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-signed\-bitfields
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-unsigned\-bitfields
+These options control whether a bitfield is
+signed or unsigned, when declared with no explicit `\|\c
+.B signed\c
+\&\|' or `\|\c
+.B unsigned\c
+\&\|' qualifier.  By default, such a bitfield is
+signed, because this is consistent: the basic integer types such as
+.B int\c
+\& are signed types.
+.Sp
+However, when you specify `\|\c
+.B \-traditional\c
+\&\|', bitfields are all unsigned
+no matter what.
+.TP
+.B \-fwritable\-strings
+Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
+them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they
+can write into string constants.  `\|\c
+.B \-traditional\c
+\&\|' also has this
+effect.
+.Sp
+Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; \*(lqconstants\*(rq should
+be constant.
+.SH PREPROCESSOR OPTIONS
+These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
+file before actual compilation.
+.PP
+If you use the `\|\c
+.B \-E\c
+\&\|' option, GCC does nothing except preprocessing.
+Some of these options make sense only together with `\|\c
+.B \-E\c
+\&\|' because
+they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
+compilation.
+.TP
+.BI "\-include " "file"
+Process \c
+.I file\c
+\& as input before processing the regular input file.
+In effect, the contents of \c
+.I file\c
+\& are compiled first.  Any `\|\c
+.B \-D\c
+\&\|'
+and `\|\c
+.B \-U\c
+\&\|' options on the command line are always processed before
+`\|\c
+.B \-include \c
+.I file\c
+\&\c
+\&\|', regardless of the order in which they are
+written.  All the `\|\c
+.B \-include\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-imacros\c
+\&\|' options are
+processed in the order in which they are written.
+.TP
+.BI "\-imacros " file
+Process \c
+.I file\c
+\& as input, discarding the resulting output, before
+processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated from
+.I file\c
+\& is discarded, the only effect of `\|\c
+.B \-imacros \c
+.I file\c
+\&\c
+\&\|' is to
+make the macros defined in \c
+.I file\c
+\& available for use in the main
+input.  The preprocessor evaluates any `\|\c
+.B \-D\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-U\c
+\&\|' options
+on the command line before processing `\|\c
+.B \-imacros\c
+.I file\c
+\&\|', regardless of the order in
+which they are written.  All the `\|\c
+.B \-include\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-imacros\c
+\&\|'
+options are processed in the order in which they are written.
+.TP
+.BI "\-idirafter " "dir"
+Add the directory \c
+.I dir\c
+\& to the second include path.  The directories
+on the second include path are searched when a header file is not found
+in any of the directories in the main include path (the one that
+`\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' adds to).
+.TP
+.BI "\-iprefix " "prefix"
+Specify \c
+.I prefix\c
+\& as the prefix for subsequent `\|\c
+.B \-iwithprefix\c
+\&\|'
+options.
+.TP
+.BI "\-iwithprefix " "dir"
+Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name is
+made by concatenating \c
+.I prefix\c
+\& and \c
+.I dir\c
+\&, where \c
+.I prefix
+was specified previously with `\|\c
+.B \-iprefix\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.B \-nostdinc
+Do not search the standard system directories for header files.  Only
+the directories you have specified with `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' options (and the
+current directory, if appropriate) are searched.
+.Sp
+By using both `\|\c
+.B \-nostdinc\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|', you can limit the include-file search file to only those
+directories you specify explicitly.
+.TP
+.B \-nostdinc++
+Do not search for header files in the C++\-specific standard directories,
+but do still search the other standard directories.
+(This option is used when building `\|\c

+.TP
+.B \-undef
+Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Including architecture flags).

+.B \-E
+Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the C source files
+specified and output the results to standard output or to the

+Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for \c

+file name for that source file and whose dependencies are all the files
+`\|\c

+\&\|' options.
+.TP
+.B \-dM
+Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the macro definitions
+that are in effect at the end of preprocessing.  Used with the `\|\c
+.B \-E\c
+\&\|'
+option.
+.TP
+.B \-dD
+Tell the preprocessor to pass all macro definitions into the output, in
+their proper sequence in the rest of the output.
+.TP
+.B \-dN
+Like `\|\c
+.B \-dD\c
+\&\|' except that the macro arguments and contents are omitted.
+Only `\|\c
+.B #define \c
+.I name\c
+\&\c
+\&\|' is included in the output.
+.SH ASSEMBLER OPTION
+.TP
+.BI "\-Wa," "option"
+Pass \c
+.I option\c
+\& as an option to the assembler.  If \c
+.I option
+contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
+.SH LINKER OPTIONS
+These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
+an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
+not doing a link step.
+.TP
+.I object-file-name
+A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
+considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
+distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
+contents.)  If GCC does a link step, these object files are used as input
+to the linker.
+.TP
+.BI \-l library
+Use the library named \c
+.I library\c
+\& when linking.
+.Sp
+The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
+which is actually a file named `\|\c
+.B lib\c
+.I library\c
+\&.a\c
+\&\|'.  The linker
+then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
+.Sp
+The directories searched include several standard system directories
+plus any that you specify with `\|\c
+.B \-L\c
+\&\|'.
+.Sp
+Normally the files found this way are library files\(em\&archive files
+whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
+scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
+been referenced but not defined.  However, if the linker finds an
+ordinary object file rather than a library, the object file is linked
+in the usual fashion.  The only difference between using an `\|\c
+.B \-l\c
+\&\|' option and specifying a file
+name is that `\|\c
+.B \-l\c
+\&\|' surrounds
+.I library
+with `\|\c
+.B lib\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B .a\c
+\&\|' and searches several directories.
+.TP
+.B \-lobjc
+You need this special case of the
+.B \-l
+option in order to link an Objective C program.
+.TP
+.B \-nostartfiles
+Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
+The standard libraries are used normally.
+.TP
+.B \-nostdlib
+Don't use the standard system libraries and startup files when linking.
+Only the files you specify will be passed to the linker.
+.TP
+.B \-static
+On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
+libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.
+.TP
+.B \-shared
+Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
+form an executable.  Only a few systems support this option.
+.TP
+.B \-symbolic
+Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
+about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
+option `\|\c
+.B
+\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\c
+\&\|').  Only a few systems support
+this option.
+.TP
+.BI "\-Xlinker " "option"
+Pass \c
+.I option
+as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
+supply system-specific linker options which GNU CC does not know how to
+recognize.
+.Sp
+If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
+`\|\c
+.B \-Xlinker\c
+\&\|' twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
+For example, to pass `\|\c
+.B
+\-assert definitions\c
+\&\|', you must write
+`\|\c
+.B
+\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\c
+\&\|'.  It does not work to write
+`\|\c
+.B
+\-Xlinker "\-assert definitions"\c
+\&\|', because this passes the entire
+string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
+.TP
+.BI "\-Wl," "option"
+Pass \c
+.I option\c
+\& as an option to the linker.  If \c
+.I option\c
+\& contains
+commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
+.TP
+.BI "\-u " "symbol"
+Pretend the symbol
+.I symbol
+is undefined, to force linking of
+library modules to define it.  You can use `\|\c
+.B \-u\c
+\&\|' multiple times with
+different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
+.SH DIRECTORY OPTIONS
+These options specify directories to search for header files, for
+libraries and for parts of the compiler:
+.TP
+.BI "\-I" "dir"
+Append directory \c
+.I dir\c
+\& to the list of directories searched for include files.
+.TP
+.B \-I\-
+Any directories you specify with `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' options before the `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|'
+option are searched only for the case of `\|\c
+.B
+#include "\c
+.I file\c
+.B
+\&"\c
+\&\|';
+they are not searched for `\|\c
+.B #include <\c
+.I file\c
+\&>\c
+\&\|'.
+.Sp
+If additional directories are specified with `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' options after
+the `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|', these directories are searched for all `\|\c
+.B #include\c
+\&\|'
+directives.  (Ordinarily \c
+.I all\c
+\& `\|\c
+.B \-I\c
+\&\|' directories are used
+this way.)
+.Sp
+In addition, the `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|' option inhibits the use of the current
+directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
+directory for `\|\c
+.B
+#include "\c
+.I file\c
+.B
+\&"\c
+\&\|'.  There is no way to
+override this effect of `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|'.  With `\|\c
+.B \-I.\c
+\&\|' you can specify
+searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
+invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
+by default, but it is often satisfactory.
+.Sp
+`\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|' does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
+for header files.  Thus, `\|\c
+.B \-I\-\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-nostdinc\c
+\&\|' are
+independent.
+.TP
+.BI "\-L" "dir"
+Add directory \c
+.I dir\c
+\& to the list of directories to be searched
+for `\|\c
+.B \-l\c
+\&\|'.
+.TP
+.BI "\-B" "prefix"
+This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries and
+data files of the compiler itself.
+.Sp
+The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
+`\|\c
+.B cpp\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B cc1\c
+\&\|' (or, for C++, `\|\c
+.B cc1plus\c
+\&\|'), `\|\c
+.B as\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B ld\c
+\&\|'.  It tries
+.I prefix\c
+\& as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
+without `\|\c
+.I machine\c
+.B /\c
+.I version\c
+.B /\c
+\&\|'.
+.Sp
+For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
+`\|\c
+.B \-B\c
+\&\|' prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if `\|\c
+.B \-B\c
+\&\|'
+was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
+`\|\c
+.B /usr/lib/gcc/\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/\c
+\&\|'.  If neither of
+those results in a file name that is found, the compiler driver
+searches for the unmodified program
+name, using the directories specified in your
+`\|\c
+.B PATH\c
+\&\|' environment variable.
+.Sp
+The run-time support file `\|\c
+.B libgcc.a\c
+\&\|' is also searched for using the
+`\|\c
+.B \-B\c
+\&\|' prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
+standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
+out of the link if it is not found by those means.  Most of the time,
+on most machines, `\|\c
+.B libgcc.a\c
+\&\|' is not actually necessary.
+.Sp
+You can get a similar result from the environment variable
+.B GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\c
+\&; if it is defined, its value is used as a prefix
+in the same way.  If both the `\|\c
+.B \-B\c
+\&\|' option and the
+.B GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\c
+\& variable are present, the `\|\c
+.B \-B\c
+\&\|' option is
+used first and the environment variable value second.
+.SH WARNING OPTIONS
+Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
+are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
+may have been an error.
+.Sp
+These options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by GNU
+CC:
+.TP
+.B \-fsyntax\-only
+Check the code for syntax errors, but don't emit any output.
+.TP
+.B \-w
+Inhibit all warning messages.
+.TP
+.B \-Wno\-import
+Inhibit warning messages about the use of
+.BR #import .
+.TP
+.B \-pedantic
+Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI standard C; reject
+all programs that use forbidden extensions.
+.Sp
+Valid ANSI standard C programs should compile properly with or without
+this option (though a rare few will require `\|\c
+.B \-ansi\c
+\&\|').  However,
+without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C features
+are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.  There is
+no reason to \c
+.I use\c
+\& this option; it exists only to satisfy pedants.
+.Sp
+`\|\c
+.B \-pedantic\c
+\&\|' does not cause warning messages for use of the
+alternate keywords whose names begin and end with `\|\c
+.B _\|_\c
+\&\|'.  Pedantic
+warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
+.B _\|_extension_\|_\c
+\&.  However, only system header files should use
+these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
+.TP
+.B \-pedantic\-errors
+Like `\|\c
+.B \-pedantic\c
+\&\|', except that errors are produced rather than
+warnings.
+.TP
+.B \-W
+Print extra warning messages for these events:
+.TP
+\ \ \ \(bu
+A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
+.B longjmp\c
+\&.  These warnings are possible only in
+optimizing compilation.
+.Sp
+The compiler sees only the calls to \c
+.B setjmp\c
+\&.  It cannot know
+where \c
+.B longjmp\c
+\& will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
+call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
+even when there is in fact no problem because \c
+.B longjmp\c
+\& cannot
+in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.
+.TP
+\ \ \ \(bu
+A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
+off the end of the function body is considered returning without
+a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
+warning:
+.Sp
+.nf
+foo (a)
+{
+  if (a > 0)
+    return a;
+}
+.Sp
+.fi
+Spurious warnings can occur because GNU CC does not realize that
+certain functions (including \c
+.B abort\c
+\& and \c
+.B longjmp\c
+\&)
+will never return.
+.TP
+\ \ \ \(bu
+An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
+contains no side effects. 
+To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void.
+For example, an expression such as `\|\c
+.B x[i,j]\c
+\&\|' will cause a warning,
+but `\|\c
+.B x[(void)i,j]\c
+\&\|' will not.
+.TP
+\ \ \ \(bu
+An unsigned value is compared against zero with `\|\c
+.B >\c
+\&\|' or `\|\c
+.B <=\c
+\&\|'.
+.PP
+.TP
+.B \-Wimplicit-int
+Warn whenever a declaration does not specify a type.
+.TP
+.B \-Wimplicit-function-declaration
+Warn whenever a function is used before being declared.
+.TP
+.B \-Wimplicit
+Same as -Wimplicit-int and -Wimplicit-function-declaration.
+.TP
+.B \-Wmain
+Warn if the
+.B main
+function is declared or defined with a suspicious type.
+Typically, it is a function with external linkage, returning
+.B int\c
+\&, and
+taking zero or two arguments.
+
+.TP
+.B \-Wreturn\-type
+Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults
+to \c
+.B int\c
+\&.  Also warn about any \c
+.B return\c
+\& statement with no
+return-value in a function whose return-type is not \c
+.B void\c
+\&.
+.TP
+.B \-Wunused
+Warn whenever a local variable is unused aside from its declaration,
+whenever a function is declared static but never defined, and whenever
+a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.
+.TP
+.B \-Wswitch
+Warn whenever a \c
+.B switch\c
+\& statement has an index of enumeral type
+and lacks a \c
+.B case\c
+\& for one or more of the named codes of that
+enumeration.  (The presence of a \c
+.B default\c
+\& label prevents this
+warning.)  \c
+.B case\c
+\& labels outside the enumeration range also
+provoke warnings when this option is used.
+.TP
+.B \-Wcomment
+Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `\|\c
+.B /\(**\c
+\&\|' appears in a comment.
+.TP
+.B \-Wtrigraphs
+Warn if any trigraphs are encountered (assuming they are enabled).
+.TP
+.B \-Wformat
+Check calls to \c
+.B printf\c
+\& and \c
+.B scanf\c
+\&, etc., to make sure that
+the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
+specified.
+.TP
+.B \-Wchar\-subscripts
+Warn if an array subscript has type
+.BR char .
+This is a common cause of error, as programmers often forget that this
+type is signed on some machines.
+.TP
+.B \-Wuninitialized
+An automatic variable is used without first being initialized.
+.Sp
+These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
+because they require data flow information that is computed only
+when optimizing.  If you don't specify `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|', you simply won't
+get these warnings.
+.Sp
+These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
+register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
+is declared \c
+.B volatile\c
+\&, or whose address is taken, or whose size
+is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
+structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.
+.Sp
+Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
+to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
+computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
+are printed.
+.Sp
+These warnings are made optional because GNU CC is not smart
+enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
+despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
+this can happen:
+.Sp
+.nf
+{
+  int x;
+  switch (y)
+    {
+    case 1: x = 1;
+      break;
+    case 2: x = 4;
+      break;
+    case 3: x = 5;
+    }
+  foo (x);
+}
+.Sp
+.fi
+If the value of \c
+.B y\c
+\& is always 1, 2 or 3, then \c
+.B x\c
+\& is
+always initialized, but GNU CC doesn't know this.  Here is
+another common case:
+.Sp
+.nf
+{
+  int save_y;
+  if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
+  .\|.\|.
+  if (change_y) y = save_y;
+}
+.Sp
+.fi
+This has no bug because \c
+.B save_y\c
+\& is used only if it is set.
+.Sp
+Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare as
+.B volatile\c
+\& all the functions you use that never return.
+.TP
+.B \-Wparentheses
+Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts.
+.TP
+.B \-Wtemplate\-debugging
+When using templates in a C++ program, warn if debugging is not yet
+fully available (C++ only).
+.TP
+.B \-Wall
+All of the above `\|\c
+.B \-W\c
+\&\|' options combined.  These are all the
+options which pertain to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we
+believe is easy to avoid, even in conjunction with macros.
+.PP
+The remaining `\|\c
+.B \-W.\|.\|.\c
+\&\|' options are not implied by `\|\c
+.B \-Wall\c
+\&\|'
+because they warn about constructions that we consider reasonable to
+use, on occasion, in clean programs.
+.TP
+.B \-Wtraditional
+Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
+ANSI C.
+.TP
+\ \ \ \(bu
+Macro arguments occurring within string constants in the macro body.
+These would substitute the argument in traditional C, but are part of
+the constant in ANSI C.
+.TP
+\ \ \ \(bu
+A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
+the block.
+.TP
+\ \ \ \(bu
+A \c
+.B switch\c
+\& statement has an operand of type \c
+.B long\c
+\&.
+.PP
+.TP
+.B \-Wshadow
+Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable.
+.TP
+.BI "\-Wid\-clash\-" "len"
+Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first \c
+.I len
+characters.  This may help you prepare a program that will compile
+with certain obsolete, brain-damaged compilers.
+.TP
+.B \-Wpointer\-arith
+Warn about anything that depends on the \*(lqsize of\*(rq a function type or
+of \c
+.B void\c
+\&.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
+convenience in calculations with \c
+.B void \(**\c
+\& pointers and pointers
+to functions.
+.TP
+.B \-Wcast\-qual
+Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
+the target type.  For example, warn if a \c
+.B const char \(**\c
+\& is cast
+to an ordinary \c
+.B char \(**\c
+\&.
+.TP
+.B \-Wcast\-align
+Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
+target is increased.  For example, warn if a \c
+.B char \(**\c
+\& is cast to
+an \c
+.B int \(**\c
+\& on machines where integers can only be accessed at
+two- or four-byte boundaries.
+.TP
+.B \-Wwrite\-strings
+Give string constants the type \c
+.B const char[\c
+.I length\c
+.B ]\c
+\& so that
+copying the address of one into a non-\c
+.B const\c
+\& \c
+.B char \(**
+pointer will get a warning.  These warnings will help you find at
+compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
+only if you have been very careful about using \c
+.B const\c
+\& in
+declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
+this is why we did not make `\|\c
+.B \-Wall\c
+\&\|' request these warnings.
+.TP
+.B \-Wconversion
+Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
+would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
+includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
+conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
+except when the same as the default promotion.
+.TP
+.B \-Waggregate\-return
+Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
+called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
+a warning.)
+.TP
+.B \-Wstrict\-prototypes
+Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
+argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
+a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
+types.)
+.TP
+.B \-Wmissing\-prototypes
+Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
+declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
+provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
+to be declared in header files.
+.TP
+.B \-Wmissing\-declarations
+Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
+Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
+Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
+header files.
+.TP
+.B \-Wredundant-decls
+Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
+cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
+.TP
+.B \-Wnested-externs
+Warn if an \c
+.B extern\c
+\& declaration is encountered within an function.
+.TP
+.B \-Wenum\-clash
+Warn about conversion between different enumeration types (C++ only).
+.TP
+.B \-Wlong-long
+Warn if
+.B long long \c
+type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
+the warning messages, use flag `\|\c
+.B \-Wno\-long\-long\c
+\&\|'.  Flags `\|\c
+.B \-W\-long\-long\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-Wno\-long\-long\c
+\&\|' are taken into account only when flag `\|\c
+.B \-pedantic\c
+\&\|' is used.
+.TP
+.B \-Woverloaded\-virtual
+(C++ only.)
+In a derived class, the definitions of virtual functions must match
+the type signature of a virtual function declared in the base class.
+Use this option to request warnings when a derived class declares a
+function that may be an erroneous attempt to define a virtual
+function: that is, warn when a function with the same name as a
+virtual function in the base class, but with a type signature that
+doesn't match any virtual functions from the base class.
+.TP
+.B \-Winline
+Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared as inline,
+or else the
+.B \-finline\-functions
+option was given.
+.TP
+.B \-Werror
+Treat warnings as errors; abort compilation after any warning.
+.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS
+GNU CC has various special options that are used for debugging
+either your program or GCC:
+.TP
+.B \-g
+Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
+(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging
+information.
+.Sp
+On most systems that use stabs format, `\|\c
+.B \-g\c
+\&\|' enables use of extra
+debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
+makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other debuggers
+crash or
+refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
+to generate the extra information, use `\|\c
+.B \-gstabs+\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B \-gstabs\c
+\&\|',
+`\|\c
+.B \-gxcoff+\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B \-gxcoff\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B \-gdwarf+\c
+\&\|', or `\|\c
+.B \-gdwarf\c
+\&\|'
+(see below).
+.Sp
+Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to use `\|\c
+.B \-g\c
+\&\|' with
+`\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|'.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
+produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
+at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
+some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
+results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
+execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
+.Sp
+Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
+it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
+.PP
+The following options are useful when GNU CC is generated with the
+capability for more than one debugging format.
+.TP
+.B \-ggdb
+Produce debugging information in the native format (if that is supported),
+including GDB extensions if at all possible.
+.TP
+.B \-gstabs
+Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
+without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
+systems.
+.TP
+.B \-gstabs+
+Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
+using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
+use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
+refuse to read the program.
+.TP
+.B \-gcoff
+Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported).
+This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to
+System V Release 4.
+.TP
+.B \-gxcoff
+Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported).
+This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.
+.TP
+.B \-gxcoff+
+Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
+using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
+use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
+refuse to read the program.
+.TP
+.B \-gdwarf
+Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported).
+This is the format used by SDB on most System V Release 4 systems.
+.TP
+.B \-gdwarf+
+Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported),
+using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
+use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
+refuse to read the program.

+.SH OPTIMIZATION OPTIONS
+These options control various sorts of optimizations:
+.TP
+.B \-O
+.TP
+.B \-O1
+Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
+more memory for a large function.
+.Sp
+Without `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|', the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
+compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
+Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
+between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
+change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
+get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.
+.Sp
+Without `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|', only variables declared \c
+.B register\c
+\& are
+allocated in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little worse
+than produced by PCC without `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|'.
+.Sp
+With `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
+time.
+.Sp
+When you specify `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|', the two options `\|\c
+.B \-fthread\-jumps\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-fdefer\-pop\c
+\&\|' are turned on.  On machines that have delay slots, the `\|\c
+.B \-fdelayed\-branch\c
+\&\|' option is turned on.  For those machines that can support debugging even
+without a frame pointer, the `\|\c
+.B \-fomit\-frame\-pointer\c
+\&\|' option is turned on.  On some machines other flags may also be turned on.
+.TP
+.B \-O2
+Optimize even more.  Nearly all supported optimizations that do not
+involve a space-speed tradeoff are performed.  Loop unrolling and function
+inlining are not done, for example.  As compared to
+.B \-O\c
+\&,
+this option increases both compilation time and the performance of the
+generated code.
+.TP
+.B \-O3
+Optimize yet more. This turns on everything
+.B \-O2
+does, along with also turning on
+.B \-finline\-functions.
+.TP
+.B \-O0
+Do not optimize.
+.Sp
+If you use multiple
+.B \-O
+options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the
+one that is effective.
+.PP
+Options of the form `\|\c
+.B \-f\c
+.I flag\c
+\&\c
+\&\|' specify machine-independent
+flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
+form of `\|\c
+.B \-ffoo\c
+\&\|' would be `\|\c
+.B \-fno\-foo\c
+\&\|'.  The following list shows
+only one form\(em\&the one which is not the default.
+You can figure out the other form by either removing `\|\c
+.B no\-\c
+\&\|' or
+adding it.
+.TP
+.B \-ffloat\-store
+Do not store floating point variables in registers.  This
+prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as the
+68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
+precision than a \c
+.B double\c
+\& is supposed to have.
+.Sp
+For most programs, the excess precision does only good, but a few
+programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating point.
+Use `\|\c
+.B \-ffloat\-store\c
+\&\|' for such programs.
+.TP
+.B \-fmemoize\-lookups
+.TP
+.B \-fsave\-memoized
+Use heuristics to compile faster (C++ only).  These heuristics are not
+enabled by default, since they are only effective for certain input
+files.  Other input files compile more slowly.
+.Sp
+The first time the compiler must build a call to a member function (or
+reference to a data member), it must (1) determine whether the class
+implements member functions of that name; (2) resolve which member
+function to call (which involves figuring out what sorts of type
+conversions need to be made); and (3) check the visibility of the member
+function to the caller.  All of this adds up to slower compilation.
+Normally, the second time a call is made to that member function (or
+reference to that data member), it must go through the same lengthy
+process again.  This means that code like this
+.Sp
+\&  cout << "This " << p << " has " << n << " legs.\en";
+.Sp
+makes six passes through all three steps.  By using a software cache,
+a \*(lqhit\*(rq significantly reduces this cost.  Unfortunately, using the
+cache introduces another layer of mechanisms which must be implemented,
+and so incurs its own overhead.  `\|\c
+.B \-fmemoize\-lookups\c
+\&\|' enables
+the software cache.
+.Sp
+Because access privileges (visibility) to members and member functions
+may differ from one function context to the next,
+.B g++
+may need to flush the cache.  With the `\|\c
+.B \-fmemoize\-lookups\c
+\&\|' flag, the cache is flushed after every
+function that is compiled.  The `\|\c
+\-fsave\-memoized\c
+\&\|' flag enables the same software cache, but when the compiler
+determines that the context of the last function compiled would yield
+the same access privileges of the next function to compile, it
+preserves the cache.
+This is most helpful when defining many member functions for the same
+class: with the exception of member functions which are friends of
+other classes, each member function has exactly the same access
+privileges as every other, and the cache need not be flushed.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-default\-inline
+Don't make member functions inline by default merely because they are
+defined inside the class scope (C++ only).
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-defer\-pop
+Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that
+function returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a
+function call, the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the
+stack for several function calls and pops them all at once.
+.TP
+.B \-fforce\-mem
+Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
+arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code by making all
+memory references potential common subexpressions.  When they are
+not common subexpressions, instruction combination should
+eliminate the separate register-load.  I am interested in hearing
+about the difference this makes.
+.TP
+.B \-fforce\-addr
+Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
+doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
+`\|\c
+.B \-fforce\-mem\c
+\&\|' may.  I am interested in hearing about the
+difference this makes.
+.TP
+.B \-fomit\-frame\-pointer
+Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
+don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
+restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
+in many functions.  \c
+.I It also makes debugging impossible on most machines\c
+\&.
+.Sp
+On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no effect, because
+the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
+and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
+machine-description macro \c
+.B FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED\c
+\& controls
+whether a target machine supports this flag.
+.TP
+.B \-finline\-functions
+Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
+heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
+integrating in this way.
+.Sp
+If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
+declared \c
+.B static\c
+\&, then GCC normally does not output the function as
+assembler code in its own right.
+.TP
+.B \-fcaller\-saves
+Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by
+function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
+registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
+seems to result in better code than would otherwise be produced.
+.Sp
+This option is enabled by default on certain machines, usually those
+which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.
+.TP
+.B \-fkeep\-inline\-functions
+Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
+is declared \c
+.B static\c
+\&, nevertheless output a separate run-time
+callable version of the function.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-function\-cse
+Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
+calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.
+.Sp
+This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
+that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
+performed when this option is not used.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-peephole
+Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.
+.TP
+.B \-ffast-math
+This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules/specifications
+in the interest of optimizing code for speed.  For example, it allows
+the compiler to assume arguments to the \c
+.B sqrt\c
+\& function are
+non-negative numbers.
+.Sp
+This option should never be turned on by any `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|' option since
+it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
+an exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for
+math functions.
+.PP
+The following options control specific optimizations.  The `\|\c
+.B \-O2\c
+\&\|'
+option turns on all of these optimizations except `\|\c
+.B \-funroll\-loops\c
+\&\|'
+and `\|\c
+.B \-funroll\-all\-loops\c
+\&\|'.
+.PP
+The `\|\c
+.B \-O\c
+\&\|' option usually turns on
+the `\|\c
+.B \-fthread\-jumps\c
+\&\|' and `\|\c
+.B \-fdelayed\-branch\c
+\&\|' options, but
+specific machines may change the default optimizations.
+.PP
+You can use the following flags in the rare cases when \*(lqfine-tuning\*(rq
+of optimizations to be performed is desired.
+.TP
+.B \-fstrength\-reduce
+Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
+elimination of iteration variables.
+.TP
+.B \-fthread\-jumps
+Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
+location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
+so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
+second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
+the condition is known to be true or false.
+.TP
+.B \-funroll\-loops
+Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for loops
+whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or run time.
+.TP
+.B \-funroll\-all\-loops
+Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all loops.
+This usually makes programs run more slowly.
+.TP
+.B \-fcse\-follow\-jumps
+In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
+when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
+example, when CSE encounters an \c
+.B if\c
+\& statement with an
+.B else\c
+\& clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition
+tested is false.
+.TP
+.B \-fcse\-skip\-blocks
+This is similar to `\|\c
+.B \-fcse\-follow\-jumps\c
+\&\|', but causes CSE to
+follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
+encounters a simple \c
+.B if\c
+\& statement with no else clause,
+`\|\c
+.B \-fcse\-skip\-blocks\c
+\&\|' causes CSE to follow the jump around the
+body of the \c
+.B if\c
+\&.
+.TP
+.B \-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop
+Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been
+performed.
+.TP
+.B \-felide\-constructors
+Elide constructors when this seems plausible (C++ only).  With this
+flag, GNU C++ initializes \c
+.B y\c
+\& directly from the call to \c
+.B foo
+without going through a temporary in the following code:
+.Sp
+A foo ();
+A y = foo ();
+.Sp
+Without this option, GNU C++ first initializes \c
+.B y\c
+\& by calling the
+appropriate constructor for type \c
+.B A\c
+\&; then assigns the result of
+.B foo\c
+\& to a temporary; and, finally, replaces the initial value of
+`\|\c
+.B y\c
+\&\|' with the temporary.
+.Sp
+The default behavior (`\|\c
+.B \-fno\-elide\-constructors\c
+\&\|') is specified by
+the draft ANSI C++ standard.  If your program's constructors have side
+effects, using `\|\c
+.B \-felide-constructors\c
+\&\|' can make your program act
+differently, since some constructor calls may be omitted.
+.TP
+.B \-fexpensive\-optimizations
+Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.
+.TP
+.B \-fdelayed\-branch
+If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions
+to exploit instruction slots available after delayed branch
+instructions.
+.TP
+.B \-fschedule\-insns
+If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
+eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
+helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
+by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
+or floating point instruction is required.
+.TP
+.B \-fschedule\-insns2
+Similar to `\|\c
+.B \-fschedule\-insns\c
+\&\|', but requests an additional pass of
+instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
+especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
+registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.
+.SH TARGET OPTIONS
+By default, GNU CC compiles code for the same type of machine that you
+are using.  However, it can also be installed as a cross-compiler, to
+compile for some other type of machine.  In fact, several different
+configurations of GNU CC, for different target machines, can be
+installed side by side.  Then you specify which one to use with the
+`\|\c
+.B \-b\c
+\&\|' option.
+.PP
+In addition, older and newer versions of GNU CC can be installed side
+by side.  One of them (probably the newest) will be the default, but
+you may sometimes wish to use another.
+.TP
+.BI "\-b " "machine"
+The argument \c
+.I machine\c
+\& specifies the target machine for compilation.
+This is useful when you have installed GNU CC as a cross-compiler.
+.Sp
+The value to use for \c
+.I machine\c
+\& is the same as was specified as the
+machine type when configuring GNU CC as a cross-compiler.  For
+example, if a cross-compiler was configured with `\|\c
+.B configure
+i386v\c
+\&\|', meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
+would specify `\|\c
+.B \-b i386v\c
+\&\|' to run that cross compiler.
+.Sp
+When you do not specify `\|\c
+.B \-b\c
+\&\|', it normally means to compile for
+the same type of machine that you are using.
+.TP
+.BI "\-V " "version"
+The argument \c
+.I version\c
+\& specifies which version of GNU CC to run.
+This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
+.I version\c
+\& might be `\|\c
+.B 2.0\c
+\&\|', meaning to run GNU CC version 2.0.
+.Sp
+The default version, when you do not specify `\|\c
+.B \-V\c
+\&\|', is controlled
+by the way GNU CC is installed.  Normally, it will be a version that
+is recommended for general use.
+.SH MACHINE DEPENDENT OPTIONS
+Each of the target machine types can have its own special options,
+starting with `\|\c
+.B \-m\c
+\&\|', to choose among various hardware models or
+configurations\(em\&for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating coprocessor or
+none.  A single installed version of the compiler can compile for any
+model or configuration, according to the options specified.
+.PP
+Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
+options, usually for command-line compatibility with other compilers on
+the same platform.

+.TP

+Generate output for a 68020 (rather than a 68000).  This is the

+.TP
+.B \-m68881
+Generate output containing 68881 instructions for floating point.

+Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the compiler is
+configured for 68040-based systems.
+.TP
+.B \-m68020\-40
+Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new instructions.

+Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for floating point.

+.TP
+.B \-mrtd
+Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
+that take a fixed number of arguments return with the \c

+instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
+saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
+the arguments there.
+.Sp
+This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
+used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
+compiled with the Unix compiler.
+.Sp
+Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
+take variable numbers of arguments (including \c
+.B printf\c
+\&);
+otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
+functions.

+In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a

+.B \-mstrict\-align
+.TP
+.B \-mno\-strict\-align
+Do not permit (do permit) unaligned accesses.
+.TP
+.B \-mold\-align
+Enable structure-alignment compatibility with Intel's gcc release version
+1.3 (based on gcc 1.37).  Currently this is buggy in that
+.B #pragma align 1
+is always assumed as well, and cannot be turned off.
+.PP
+These `\|\c
+.B \-m\c
+\&\|' options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:
+.TP
+.B \-mno-soft-float
+.TP
+.B \-msoft-float
+Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
+floating-point operations.  When \c
+.B \-msoft-float\c
+\& is specified,
+functions in `\|\c
+.B libgcc1.c\c
+\&\|' will be used to perform floating-point
+operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
+floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
+emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
+operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
+operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
+them.
+.Sp
+Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
+required to have floating-point registers.
+.TP
+.B \-mfp-reg
+.TP
+.B \-mno-fp-regs
+Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
+.B \-mno-fp-regs\c
+\& implies \c
+.B \-msoft-float\c
+\&.  If the floating-point
+register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
+registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
+in $0 instead of $f0.  This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any
+function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
+compiled with \c
+.B \-mno-fp-regs\c
+\& must also be compiled with that
+option.
+.Sp
+A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
+and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
+.PP
+These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for
+compatibility with other compilers on those systems:
+.TP
+.B \-G
+On SVr4 systems, \c
+.B gcc\c
+\& accepts the option `\|\c
+.B \-G\c
+\&\|' (and passes
+it to the system linker), for compatibility with other compilers.
+However, we suggest you use `\|\c
+.B \-symbolic\c
+\&\|' or `\|\c
+.B \-shared\c
+\&\|' as
+appropriate, instead of supplying linker options on the \c
+.B gcc
+command line.
+.TP
+.B \-Qy
+Identify the versions of each tool used by the compiler, in a
+.B .ident\c
+\& assembler directive in the output.
+.TP
+.B \-Qn
+Refrain from adding \c
+.B .ident\c
+\& directives to the output file (this is
+the default).
+.TP
+.BI "\-YP," "dirs"
+Search the directories \c
+.I dirs\c
+\&, and no others, for libraries
+specified with `\|\c
+.B \-l\c
+\&\|'.  You can separate directory entries in
+.I dirs\c
+\& from one another with colons.
+.TP
+.BI "\-Ym," "dir"
+Look in the directory \c
+.I dir\c
+\& to find the M4 preprocessor.
+The assembler uses this option.
+.SH CODE GENERATION OPTIONS
+These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
+used in code generation.
+.PP
+Most of them begin with `\|\c
+\-f\c
+\&\|'.  These options have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
+of `\|\c
+.B \-ffoo\c
+\&\|' would be `\|\c
+.B \-fno\-foo\c
+\&\|'.  In the table below, only
+one of the forms is listed\(em\&the one which is not the default.  You
+can figure out the other form by either removing `\|\c
+.B no\-\c
+\&\|' or adding
+it.
+.TP
+.B \-fnonnull\-objects
+Assume that objects reached through references are not null
+(C++ only).
+.Sp
+Normally, GNU C++ makes conservative assumptions about objects reached
+through references.  For example, the compiler must check that \c
+.B a
+is not null in code like the following:
+.Sp
+obj &a = g ();
+a.f (2);
+.Sp
+Checking that references of this sort have non-null values requires
+extra code, however, and it is unnecessary for many programs.  You can
+use `\|\c
+.B \-fnonnull-objects\c
+\&\|' to omit the checks for null, if your
+program doesn't require checking.
+.TP
+.B \-fpcc\-struct\-return
+Use the same convention for returning \c
+.B struct\c
+\& and \c
+.B union
+values that is used by the usual C compiler on your system.  This
+convention is less efficient for small structures, and on many
+machines it fails to be reentrant; but it has the advantage of
+allowing intercallability between GCC-compiled code and PCC-compiled
+code.
+.TP
+.B \-freg\-struct\-return
+Use the convention that
+.B struct
+and
+.B union
+values are returned in registers when possible.  This is more
+efficient for small structures than
+.BR \-fpcc\-struct\-return .
+.Sp
+If you specify neither
+.B \-fpcc\-struct\-return
+nor
+.BR \-freg\-struct\-return ,
+GNU CC defaults to whichever convention is standard for the target.
+If there is no standard convention, GNU CC defaults to
+.BR \-fpcc\-struct\-return .
+.TP
+.B \-fshort\-enums
+Allocate to an \c
+.B enum\c
+\& type only as many bytes as it needs for the
+declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the \c
+.B enum\c
+\& type
+will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.
+.TP
+.B \-fshort\-double
+Use the same size for
+.B double
+as for
+.B float
+\&.
+.TP
+.B \-fshared\-data
+Requests that the data and non-\c
+.B const\c
+\& variables of this
+compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The distinction
+makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data is
+shared between processes running the same program, while private data
+exists in one copy per process.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-common
+Allocate even uninitialized global variables in the bss section of the
+object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
+effect that if the same variable is declared (without \c
+.B extern\c
+\&) in
+two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.
+The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
+program will work on other systems which always work this way.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-ident
+Ignore the `\|\c
+.B #ident\c
+\&\|' directive.
+.TP
+.B \-fno\-gnu\-linker
+Do not output global initializations (such as C++ constructors and
+destructors) in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where the GNU
+linker is the standard method of handling them).  Use this option when
+you want to use a non-GNU linker, which also requires using the
+.B collect2\c
+\& program to make sure the system linker includes
+constructors and destructors.  (\c
+.B collect2\c
+\& is included in the GNU CC
+distribution.)  For systems which \c
+.I must\c
+\& use \c
+.B collect2\c
+\&, the
+compiler driver \c
+.B gcc\c
+\& is configured to do this automatically.
+.TP
+.B \-finhibit-size-directive
+Don't output a \c
+.B .size\c
+\& assembler directive, or anything else that
+would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
+two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
+used when compiling `\|\c
+.B crtstuff.c\c
+\&\|'; you should not need to use it
+for anything else.
+.TP
+.B \-fverbose-asm
+Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
+make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
+who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
+debugging the compiler itself).
+.TP
+.B \-fvolatile
+Consider all memory references through pointers to be volatile.
+.TP
+.B \-fvolatile\-global
+Consider all memory references to extern and global data items to
+be volatile.
+.TP
+.B \-fpic
+If supported for the target machines, generate position-independent code,
+suitable for use in a shared library.
+.TP
+.B \-fPIC
+If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
+suitable for dynamic linking, even if branches need large displacements.
+.TP
+.BI "\-ffixed\-" "reg"
+Treat the register named \c
+.I reg\c
+\& as a fixed register; generated code
+should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
+pointer or in some other fixed role).
+.Sp
+.I reg\c
+\& must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
+are machine-specific and are defined in the \c
+.B REGISTER_NAMES
+macro in the machine description macro file.
+.Sp
+This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
+three-way choice.
+.TP
+.BI "\-fcall\-used\-" "reg"
+Treat the register named \c
+.I reg\c
+\& as an allocable register that is
+clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
+variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
+will not save and restore the register \c
+.I reg\c
+\&.
+.Sp
+Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in the
+machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame pointer,
+will produce disastrous results.
+.Sp
+This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
+three-way choice.
+.TP
+.BI "\-fcall\-saved\-" "reg"
+Treat the register named \c
+.I reg\c
+\& as an allocable register saved by
+functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
+live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
+the register \c
+.I reg\c
+\& if they use it.
+.Sp
+Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in the
+machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame pointer,
+will produce disastrous results.
+.Sp
+A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
+a register in which function values may be returned.
+.Sp
+This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
+three-way choice.
+.SH PRAGMAS
+Two `\|\c
+.B #pragma\c
+\&\|' directives are supported for GNU C++, to permit using the same
+header file for two purposes: as a definition of interfaces to a given
+object class, and as the full definition of the contents of that object class.
+.TP
+.B #pragma interface
+(C++ only.)
+Use this directive in header files that define object classes, to save
+space in most of the object files that use those classes.  Normally,
+local copies of certain information (backup copies of inline member
+functions, debugging information, and the internal tables that
+implement virtual functions) must be kept in each object file that
+includes class definitions.  You can use this pragma to avoid such
+duplication.  When a header file containing `\|\c
+.B #pragma interface\c
+\&\|' is included in a compilation, this auxiliary information
+will not be generated (unless the main input source file itself uses
+`\|\c
+.B #pragma implementation\c
+\&\|').  Instead, the object files will contain references to be
+resolved at link time.
+.TP
+.B #pragma implementation
+.TP
+\fB#pragma implementation "\fP\fIobjects\fP\fB.h"\fP
+(C++ only.)
+Use this pragma in a main input file, when you want full output from
+included header files to be generated (and made globally visible).
+The included header file, in turn, should use `\|\c
+.B #pragma interface\c
+\&\|'.
+Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging information, and
+the internal tables used to implement virtual functions are all
+generated in implementation files.
+.Sp
+If you use `\|\c
+.B #pragma implementation\c
+\&\|' with no argument, it applies to an include file with the same
+basename as your source file; for example, in `\|\c
+.B allclass.cc\c
+\&\|', `\|\c
+.B #pragma implementation\c
+\&\|' by itself is equivalent to `\|\c
+.B
+#pragma implementation "allclass.h"\c
+\&\|'.  Use the string argument if you want a single implementation
+file to include code from multiple header files.
+.Sp
+There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file into
+multiple implementation files.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\c
+.B ld\c
+\& combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
+their data and ties up symbol references. Often the last step in
+building a new compiled program to run is a call to \c
+.B ld\c
+\&.
+
+\c
+.B ld\c
+\& accepts Linker Command Language files 
+to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.
+This man page does not describe the command language; see the `\|\c
+.B ld\c
+\|' entry in `\|\c
+.B info\c
+\|', or the manual
+.I
+ld: the GNU linker
+\&, for full details on the command language and on other aspects of
+the GNU linker. 
+
+This version of \c
+.B ld\c
+\& uses the general purpose BFD libraries
+to operate on object files. This allows \c
+.B ld\c
+\& to read, combine, and
+write object files in many different formats\(em\&for example, COFF or
+\c
+.B a.out\c
+\&.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
+available kind of object file.  You can use `\|\c
+.B objdump \-i\c
+\|' to get a list of formats supported on various architectures; see 
+.BR objdump ( 1 ).
+
+Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other
+linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
+execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
+\c
+.B ld\c
+\& continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
+(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).
+
+The GNU linker \c
+.B ld\c
+\& is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
+and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result,
+you have many choices to control its behavior through the command line,
+and through environment variables.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+The plethora of command-line options may seem intimidating, but in
+actual practice few of them are used in any particular context.
+For instance, a frequent use of \c
+.B ld\c
+\& is to link standard Unix
+object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
+link a file \c
+.B hello.o\c
+\&:
+.sp
+.br
+$\ ld\ \-o\ output\ /lib/crt0.o\ hello.o\ \-lc
+.br
+.sp
+This tells \c
+.B ld\c
+\& to produce a file called \c
+.B output\c
+\& as the
+result of linking the file \c
+.B /lib/crt0.o\c
+\& with \c
+.B hello.o\c
+\& and
+the library \c
+.B libc.a\c
+\& which will come from the standard search
+directories.
+
+The command-line options to \c
+.B ld\c
+\& may be specified in any order, and
+may be repeated at will.  For the most part, repeating an option with a
+different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
+occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of an
+option.  
+
+The exceptions\(em\&which may meaningfully be used more than once\(em\&are
+\c
+.B \-A\c
+\&, \c
+.B \-b\c
+\& (or its synonym \c
+.B \-format\c
+\&), \c
+.B \-defsym\c
+\&,
+\c
+.B \-L\c
+\&, \c
+.B \-l\c
+\&, \c
+.B \-R\c
+\&, and \c
+.B \-u\c
+\&.
+
+The list of object files to be linked together, shown as \c
+.I objfile\c
+\&,
+may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options; save that
+an \c
+.I objfile\c
+\& argument may not be placed between an option flag and
+its argument.
+
+Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but other
+forms of binary input files can also be specified with \c
+.B \-l\c
+\&,
+\c
+.B \-R\c
+\&, and the script command language.  If \c
+.I no\c
+\& binary input
+files at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and
+issues the message `\|\c
+.B No input files\c
+\|'.
+
+Option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
+whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
+option that requires them.
+
+.TP
+.BI "-A" "architecture"
+In the current release of \c
+.B ld\c
+\&, this option is useful only for the
+Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \c
+.B ld\c
+\& configuration, the
+\c
+.I architecture\c
+\& argument is one of the two-letter names identifying
+members of the 960 family; the option specifies the desired output
+target, and warns of any incompatible instructions in the input files.
+It also modifies the linker's search strategy for archive libraries, to
+support the use of libraries specific to each particular
+architecture, by including in the search loop names suffixed with the
+string identifying the architecture.
+
+For example, if your \c
+.B ld\c
+\& command line included `\|\c
+.B \-ACA\c
+\|' as
+well as `\|\c
+.B \-ltry\c
+\|', the linker would look (in its built-in search
+paths, and in any paths you specify with \c
+.B \-L\c
+\&) for a library with
+the names
+.sp
+.br
+try
+.br
+libtry.a
+.br
+tryca
+.br
+libtryca.a
+.br
+.sp
+
+The first two possibilities would be considered in any event; the last
+two are due to the use of `\|\c
+.B \-ACA\c

+
+Future releases of \c

+other architecture families.
+
+You can meaningfully use \c
+.B \-A\c
+\& more than once on a command line, if
+an architecture family allows combination of target architectures; each
+use will add another pair of name variants to search for when \c
+.B \-l
+specifies a library.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-b " "input-format"
+Specify the binary format for input object files that follow this option
+on the command line.  You don't usually need to specify this, as
+\c
+.B ld\c
+\& is configured to expect as a default input format the most
+usual format on each machine.  \c
+.I input-format\c
+\& is a text string, the
+name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries.  
+\c
+.B \-format \c
+.I input-format\c
+\&\c
+\& has the same effect, as does the script command
+.BR TARGET .
+
+You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
+binary format.  You can also use \c
+.B \-b\c
+\& to switch formats explicitly (when
+linking object files of different formats), by including
+\c
+.B \-b \c
+.I input-format\c
+\&\c
+\& before each group of object files in a
+particular format.  
+
+The default format is taken from the environment variable
+.B GNUTARGET\c
+\&.  You can also define the input
+format from a script, using the command \c
+.B TARGET\c
+\&.
+
+.TP
+.B \-Bstatic 
+Do not link against shared libraries.  This is only meaningful on
+platforms for which shared libraries are supported.
+
+.TP
+.B \-Bdynamic
+Link against dynamic libraries.  This is only meaningful on platforms
+for which shared libraries are supported.  This option is normally the
+default on such platforms.
+
+.TP
+.B \-Bsymbolic
+When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to
+the definition within the shared library, if any.  Normally, it is
+possible for a program linked against a shared library to override the
+definition within the shared library.  This option is only meaningful
+on ELF platforms which support shared libraries.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-c " "commandfile"
+Directs \c
+.B ld\c
+\& to read link commands from the file
+\c
+.I commandfile\c
+\&.  These commands will completely override \c
+.B ld\c
+\&'s
+default link format (rather than adding to it); \c
+.I commandfile\c
+\& must
+specify everything necessary to describe the target format.
+
+
+You may also include a script of link commands directly in the command
+line by bracketing it between `\|\c
+.B {\c
+\|' and `\|\c
+.B }\c
+\|' characters.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-cref
+Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being
+generated, the cross reference table is printed to the map file.
+Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.
+
+.TP
+.B \-d 
+.TP
+.B \-dc
+.TP
+.B \-dp
+These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
+compatibility with other linkers.  Use any of them to make \c
+.B ld
+assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is
+specified (\c
+.B \-r\c
+\&).  The script command
+\c
+.B FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\c
+\& has the same effect.
+
+.TP
+.BI "-defsym " "symbol" "\fR = \fP" expression
+Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute
+address given by \c
+.I expression\c
+\&.  You may use this option as many
+times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A
+limited form of arithmetic is supported for the \c
+.I expression\c
+\& in this
+context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing
+symbol, or use \c
+.B +\c
+\& and \c
+.B \-\c
+\& to add or subtract hexadecimal
+constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider
+using the linker command language from a script.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-demangle
+.TP
+.B \-\-no\-demangle
+These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error
+messages and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it
+tries to present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
+underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts
+C++ mangled symbol names into user readable names.  The linker will
+demangle by default unless the environment variable
+.B COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE
+is set.  These options may be used to override the default.
+
+.TP
+.BI "-e " "entry"\c
+\& 
+Use \c
+.I entry\c
+\& as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
+program, rather than the default entry point.  See the `\|\c
+.B ld\c
+\|' entry in `\|\c
+.B info\c
+\|' for a
+discussion of defaults and other ways of specifying the
+entry point.
+
+.TP
+.B \-embedded\-relocs
+This option is only meaningful when linking MIPS embedded PIC code,
+generated by the
+.B \-membedded\-pic
+option to the GNU compiler and assembler.  It causes the linker to
+create a table which may be used at runtime to relocate any data which
+was statically initialized to pointer values.  See the code in
+testsuite/ld-empic for details.
+
+.TP
+.B \-E
+.TP
+.B \-export\-dynamic
+When creating an ELF file, add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.
+Normally, the dynamic symbol table contains only symbols which are used
+by a dynamic object.  This option is needed for some uses of
+.I dlopen.
+
+.TP
+.BI "-f " "name"
+.TP
+.BI "--auxiliary " "name"
+When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field
+to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
+table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
+symbol table of the shared object
+.I name.
+
+.TP
+.BI "-F " "name"
+.TP
+.BI "--filter " "name"
+When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to
+the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
+of the shared object should be used as a filter on the symbol table of
+the shared object
+.I name.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-format " "input\-format"
+Synonym for \c
+.B \-b\c
+\& \c
+.I input\-format\c
+\&.
+
+.TP
+.B \-g
+Accepted, but ignored; provided for compatibility with other tools.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-G " "size"\c
+Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
+to
+.I size
+under MIPS ECOFF.  Ignored for other object file formats.
+
+.TP
+.BI "-h " "name"
+.TP
+.BI "-soname " "name"
+When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
+the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
+which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
+linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
+field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-help
+Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard output and exit.
+This option and
+.B \-\-version
+begin with two dashes instead of one
+for compatibility with other GNU programs.  The other options start with
+only one dash for compatibility with other linkers.
+
+.TP
+.B \-i
+Perform an incremental link (same as option \c
+.B \-r\c
+\&).
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-l" "ar"\c
+\& 
+Add an archive file \c
+.I ar\c
+\& to the list of files to link.  This 
+option may be used any number of times.  \c
+.B ld\c
+\& will search its
+path-list for occurrences of \c
+.B lib\c
+.I ar\c
+\&.a\c
+\& for every \c
+.I ar
+specified.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-L" "searchdir"
+This command adds path \c
+.I searchdir\c
+\& to the list of paths that
+\c
+.B ld\c
+\& will search for archive libraries.  You may use this option
+any number of times.
+
+The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
+\c
+.B \-L\c
+\&) depends on what emulation mode \c
+.B ld\c
+\& is using, and in
+some cases also on how it was configured.    The
+paths can also be specified in a link script with the \c
+.B SEARCH_DIR
+command.
+
+.TP
+.B \-M 
+Print (to the standard output file) a link map\(em\&diagnostic information
+about where symbols are mapped by \c
+.B ld\c
+\&, and information on global
+common storage allocation.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-Map " "mapfile"\c
+Print to the file
+.I mapfile
+a link map\(em\&diagnostic information
+about where symbols are mapped by \c
+.B ld\c
+\&, and information on global
+common storage allocation.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-m " "emulation"\c
+Emulate the
+.I emulation
+linker.  You can list the available emulations with the
+.I \-\-verbose
+or
+.I \-V
+options.  This option overrides the compiled-in default, which is the
+system for which you configured
+.BR ld .
+
+.TP
+.B \-N 
+specifies readable and writable \c
+.B text\c
+\& and \c
+.B data\c
+\& sections. If
+the output format supports Unix style magic numbers, the output is
+marked as \c
+.B OMAGIC\c
+\&.
+
+When you use the `\|\c
+.B \-N\c
+\&\|' option, the linker does not page-align the
+data segment.
+
+.TP
+.B \-n 
+sets the text segment to be read only, and \c
+.B NMAGIC\c
+\& is written
+if possible.
+
+.TP
+.B \-noinhibit\-exec
+Normally, the linker will not produce an output file if it encounters
+errors during the link process.  With this flag, you can specify that
+you wish the output file retained even after non-fatal errors.
+
+.TP
+.B \-no\-keep\-memory
+The linker normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching
+the symbol tables of input files in memory.  This option tells the
+linker to instead optimize for memory usage, by rereading the symbol
+tables as necessary.  This may be required if the linker runs out of
+memory space while linking a large executable.
+
+.TP
+.B \-no\-warn\-mismatch
+Normally the linker will give an error if you try to link together
+input files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps because they
+have been compiled for different processors or for different
+endiannesses.  This option tells the linker that it should silently
+permit such possible errors.  This option should only be used with
+care, in cases when you have taken some special action that ensures
+that the linker errors are inappropriate.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-o " "output"
+.I output\c
+\& is a name for the program produced by \c
+.B ld\c
+\&; if this
+option is not specified, the name `\|\c
+.B a.out\c
+\|' is used by default.  The
+script command \c
+.B OUTPUT\c
+\& can also specify the output file name.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-O" "level"
+Generate optimized output files.  This might use significantly more
+time and therefore probably should be enabled only for generating the
+final binary.
+\c
+.I level\c
+\& is supposed to be a numeric value.  Any value greater than zero enables
+the optimizations.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-oformat " "output\-format"
+Specify the binary format for the output object file.
+You don't usually need to specify this, as
+\c
+.B ld\c
+\& is configured to produce as a default output format the most
+usual format on each machine.  \c
+.I output-format\c
+\& is a text string, the
+name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries.  
+The script command
+.B OUTPUT_FORMAT
+can also specify the output format, but this option overrides it.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-R " "filename"
+Read symbol names and their addresses from \c
+.I filename\c
+\&, but do not
+relocate it or include it in the output.  This allows your output file
+to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
+programs.
+
+.TP
+.B \-relax
+An option with machine dependent effects.  Currently this option is only
+supported on the H8/300.
+
+On some platforms, use this option to perform global optimizations that
+become possible when the linker resolves addressing in your program, such
+as relaxing address modes and synthesizing new instructions in the
+output object file.  
+
+On platforms where this is not supported, `\|\c
+.B \-relax\c
+\&\|' is accepted, but has no effect.
+
+.TP
+.B \-r 
+Generates relocatable output\(em\&i.e., generate an output file that can in
+turn serve as input to \c
+.B ld\c
+\&.  This is often called \c
+.I partial
+linking\c
+\&.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
+magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
+\c
+.B OMAGIC\c
+\&.
+If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
+linking C++ programs, this option \c
+.I will not\c
+\& resolve references to
+constructors; \c
+.B \-Ur\c
+\& is an alternative. 
+
+This option does the same as \c
+.B \-i\c
+\&.
+
+.TP
+.B \-rpath\ \fIdirectory
+Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when
+linking an ELF executable with shared objects.  All 
+.B \-rpath
+arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
+them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The
+.B \-rpath
+option is also used when locating shared objects which are needed by
+shared objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of
+the
+.B \-rpath\-link
+option.  If
+.B \-rpath
+is not used when linking an ELF executable, the contents of the
+environment variable
+.B LD_RUN_PATH
+will be used if it is defined.
+
+The
+.B \-rpath
+option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on SunOS, the linker
+will form a runtime search path out of all the
+.B \-L
+options it is given.  If a
+.B \-rpath
+option is used, the runtime search path will be formed exclusively
+using the
+.B \-rpath
+options, ignoring
+the
+.B \-L
+options.  This can be useful when using gcc, which adds many
+.B \-L
+options which may be on NFS mounted filesystems.
+
+.TP
+.B \-rpath\-link\ \fIdirectory
+When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
+happens when an
+.B ld\ \-shared
+link includes a shared library as one of the input files.
+
+When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
+non-relocateable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
+shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
+explicitly.  In such a case, the
+.B \-rpath\-link
+option specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
+.B \-rpath\-link
+option may specify a sequence of directory names either by specifying
+a list of names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple times.
+
+If the required shared library is not found, the linker will issue a
+warning and continue with the link.
+
+.TP
+.B \-S 
+Omits debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the output file.
+
+.TP
+.B \-s 
+Omits all symbol information from the output file.
+
+.TP
+.B \-shared
+Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on ELF and
+SunOS platforms (on SunOS it is not required, as the linker will
+automatically create a shared library when there are undefined symbols
+and the
+.B \-e
+option is not used).
+
+.TP
+.B \-sort\-common
+Normally, when
+.B ld
+places the global common symbols in the appropriate output sections,
+it sorts them by size.  First come all the one byte symbols, then all
+the two bytes, then all the four bytes, and then everything else.
+This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
+alignment constraints.  This option disables that sorting.
+
+.TP
+.B \-split\-by\-reloc\ \fIcount
+Trys to creates extra sections in the output file so that no single
+output section in the file contains more than
+.I count
+relocations.
+This is useful when generating huge relocatable for downloading into
+certain real time kernels with the COFF object file format; since COFF
+cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.
+Note that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
+support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
+input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section
+contains more than
+.I count
+relocations one output section will contain that many relocations.
+
+.TP
+.B \-split\-by\-file
+Similar to
+.B \-split\-by\-reloc
+but creates a new output section for each input file.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-Tbss " "org"\c
+.TP
+.BI "\-Tdata " "org"\c
+.TP
+.BI "\-Ttext " "org"\c
+Use \c
+.I org\c
+\& as the starting address for\(em\&respectively\(em\&the
+\c
+.B bss\c
+\&, \c
+.B data\c
+\&, or the \c
+.B text\c
+\& segment of the output file.
+\c
+.I org\c
+\& must be a hexadecimal integer.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-T " "commandfile"
+Equivalent to \c
+.B \-c \c
+.I commandfile\c
+\&\c
+\&; supported for compatibility with
+other tools.  
+
+.TP
+.B \-t 
+Prints names of input files as \c
+.B ld\c
+\& processes them.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-u " "sym"
+Forces \c
+.I sym\c
+\& to be entered in the output file as an undefined symbol.
+This may, for example, trigger linking of additional modules from
+standard libraries.  \c
+.B \-u\c
+\& may be repeated with different option
+arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.
+
+.TP
+.B \-Ur 
+For anything other than C++ programs, this option is equivalent to
+\c
+.B \-r\c
+\&: it generates relocatable output\(em\&i.e., an output file that can in
+turn serve as input to \c
+.B ld\c
+\&.  When linking C++ programs, \c
+.B \-Ur
+.I will\c
+\& resolve references to constructors, unlike \c
+.B \-r\c
+\&.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-verbose
+Display the version number for \c

+and list the supported emulations.
+Display which input files can and can not be opened.
+
+.TP
+.B \-v, \-V
+Display the version number for \c
+.B ld\c
+\&.
+The
+.B \-V
+option also lists the supported emulations.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-version
+Display the version number for \c
+.B ld
+and exit.
+
+.TP
+.B \-warn\-common
+Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
+a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice,
+but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows
+you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
+
+.TP
+.B \-warn\-constructors
+Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a
+few object file formats.  For formats like COFF or ELF, the linker can
+not detect the use of global constructors.
+
+.TP
+.B \-warn\-multiple\-gp
+Warn if the output file requires multiple global-pointer values.  This
+option is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
+
+.TP
+.B \-warn\-once
+Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
+which refers to it.
+
+.TP
+.B \-warn\-section\-align
+Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
+alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
+The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that
+is, if the SECTIONS command does not specify a start address for the
+section.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-whole\-archive
+For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
+.B \-\-whole\-archive
+option, include every object file in the archive in the link, rather
+than searching the archive for the required object files.  This is
+normally used to turn an archive file into a shared library, forcing
+every object to be included in the resulting shared library.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-no\-whole\-archive
+Turn off the effect of the
+.B \-\-whole\-archive
+option for archives which appear later on the command line.
+
+.TP
+.BI "--wrap " "symbol"
+Use a wrapper function for 
+.I symbol.
+Any undefined reference to
+.I symbol
+will be resolved to
+.BI "__wrap_" "symbol".
+Any undefined reference to
+.BI "__real_" "symbol"
+will be resolved to
+.I symbol.

+.B \-X 
+Delete all temporary local symbols.  For most targets, this is all local

+.B L\c
+\|'.
+
+.TP
+.B \-x
+Delete all local symbols.
+
+.PP
+
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+\c
+You can change the behavior of
+.B ld\c
+\& with the environment variable \c
+.B GNUTARGET\c
+\&.
+
+\c
+.B GNUTARGET\c
+\& determines the input-file object format if you don't
+use \c
+.B \-b\c
+\& (or its synonym \c
+.B \-format\c
+\&).  Its value should be one
+of the BFD names for an input format.  If there is no
+\c
+.B GNUTARGET\c
+\& in the environment, \c
+.B ld\c
+\& uses the natural format
+of the host. If \c
+.B GNUTARGET\c
+\& is set to \c
+.B default\c
+\& then BFD attempts to discover the
+input format by examining binary input files; this method often
+succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no method
+of ensuring that the magic number used to flag object-file formats is
+unique.  However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each system
+places the conventional format for that system first in the search-list,
+so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.

+
+.SH OPTIONS
+The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
+equivalent.
+
+.TP
+.B \-A
+.TP
+.B \-o
+.TP
+.B \-\-print\-file\-name 
+Precede each symbol by the name of the input file where it was found,
+rather than identifying the input file once only before all of its
+symbols. 
+
+.TP
+.B \-a
+.TP
+.B \-\-debug\-syms 
+Display debugger-only symbols; normally these are not listed.
+
+.TP
+.B \-B
+The same as
+.B \-\-format=bsd
+(for compatibility with the MIPS \fBnm\fP).
+
+.TP
+.B \-C
+.TP
+.B \-\-demangle
+Decode (\fIdemangle\fP) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
+Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
+makes C++ function names readable.
+
+.TP
+.B \-D
+.TP
+.B \-\-dynamic
+Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.  This is
+only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
+libraries.
+
+.TP
+.B "\-f \fIformat"
+Use the output format \fIformat\fP, which can be ``bsd'',
+``sysv'', or ``posix''.  The default is ``bsd''.
+Only the first character of \fIformat\fP is significant; it can be
+either upper or lower case.
+
+.TP
+.B \-g
+.TP
+.B \-\-extern\-only 
+Display only external symbols.
+
+.TP
+.B \-n
+.TP
+.B \-v
+.TP
+.B \-\-numeric\-sort 
+Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, not alphabetically by their
+names. 
+
+.TP
+.B \-p
+.TP
+.B \-\-no\-sort 
+Don't bother to sort the symbols in any order; just print them in the
+order encountered.
+
+.TP
+.B \-P
+.TP
+.B \-\-portability
+Use the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of the default format.
+Equivalent to ``\-f posix''.
+
+.TP
+.B \-s
+.TP
+.B \-\-print\-armap
+When listing symbols from archive members, include the index: a mapping
+(stored in the archive by \c
+.B ar\c
+\& or \c
+.B ranlib\c
+\&) of what modules
+contain definitions for what names.
+
+.TP
+.B \-r
+.TP
+.B \-\-reverse\-sort 
+Reverse the sense of the sort (whether numeric or alphabetic); let the
+last come first.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-size\-sort 
+Sort symbols by size.  The size is computed as the difference between
+the value of the symbol and the value of the symbol with the next higher
+value.  The size of the symbol is printed, rather than the value.
+
+.TP
+.B "\-t \fIradix"
+.TP
+.B "\-\-radix=\fIradix"
+Use \fIradix\fP as the radix for printing the symbol values.  It must be
+``d'' for decimal, ``o'' for octal, or ``x'' for hexadecimal.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-target=" "bfdname"
+Specify an object code format other than your system's default format.
+See 
+.BR objdump ( 1 ),
+for information on listing available formats.

+.TP
+.B \-\-undefined\-only 
+Display only undefined symbols (those external to each object file).
+
+.TP
+.B \-l
+.TP
+.B \-\-line\-numbers
+For each symbol, use debugging information to try to find a filename and
+line number.  For a defined symbol, look for the line number of the
+address of the symbol.  For an undefined symbol, look for the line
+number of a relocation entry which refers to the symbol.  If line number
+information can be found, print it after the other symbol information.
+
+.TP
+.B \-V
+.TP
+.B \-\-version
+Show the version number of

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The GNU 
+.B objcopy
+utility copies the contents of an object file to another.  
+.B objcopy 
+uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the object files.  It can
+write the destination object file in a format different from that of
+the source object file.  The exact behavior of 
+.B objcopy
+is controlled by command-line options.
+.PP
+.B objcopy
+creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes them
+afterward.
+.B objcopy
+uses BFD to do all its translation work; it knows about all the
+formats BFD knows about, and thus is able to recognize most formats
+without being told explicitly.
+.PP
+.B objcopy
+can be used to generate S-records by using an output target of
+.B srec
+(e.g., use
+.B -O srec).
+.PP
+.B objcopy
+can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an output target of
+.B binary
+(e.g., use
+.B -O binary).
+When
+.B objcopy
+generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce a memory dump
+of the contents of the input object file.  All symbols and relocation
+information will be discarded.  The memory dump will start at the
+virtual address of the lowest section copied into the output file.
+.PP
+When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be helpful to
+use
+.B -S
+to remove sections containing debugging information.  In some cases
+.B -R
+will be useful to remove sections which contain information which is
+not needed by the binary file.
+.PP
+.I infile
+and
+.I outfile
+are the source and output files respectively.  If you do not specify
+.IR outfile ,
+.B objcopy
+creates a temporary file and destructively renames the result with the
+name of the input file.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B \-I \fIbfdname\fR, \fB\-\-input\-target=\fIbfdname
+Consider the source file's object format to be 
+.IR bfdname ,
+rather than attempting to deduce it.
+.TP
+.B \-O \fIbfdname\fR, \fB\-\-output\-target=\fIbfdname
+Write the output file using the object format 
+.IR bfdname .
+.TP
+.B \-F \fIbfdname\fR, \fB\-\-target=\fIbfdname
+Use 
+.I bfdname
+as the object format for both the input and the output file; i.e.
+simply transfer data from source to destination with no translation.
+.TP
+.B \-j \fIsectionname\fR, \fB\-\-only\-section=\fIsectionname
+Copy only the named section from the input file to the output file,
+discarding all other sections.  This option may be given more than
+once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may make the output
+file unusable.
+.TP
+.B \-R \fIsectionname\fR, \fB\-\-remove-section=\fIsectionname
+Remove the named section from the file.  This option may be given more
+than once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may make the
+output file unusable.
+.TP
+.B \-S\fR, \fB\-\-strip\-all
+Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.
+.TP
+.B \-g\fR, \fB\-\-strip\-debug
+Do not copy debugging symbols from the source file.
+.TP
+.B \-\-strip\-unneeded
+Strip all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.
+.TP
+.B \-K \fIsymbolname\fR, \fB\-\-keep\-symbol=\fIsymbolname
+Copy only symbol \fIsymbolname\fP from the source file. This option
+may be given more than once.
+.TP
+.B \-N \fIsymbolname\fR, \fB\-\-strip\-symbol=\fIsymbolname
+Do not copy symbol \fIsymbolname\fP from the source file. This option
+may be given more than once.
+.TP
+.B \-L \fIsymbolname\fR, \fB\-\-localize\-symbol=\fIsymbolname
+Make symbol \fIsymbolname\fP local to the file, so that it is not
+visible externally.  This option may be given more than once.
+.TP
+.B \-W \fIsymbolname\fR, \fB\-\-weaken\-symbol=\fIsymbolname
+Make symbol \fIsymbolname\fP weak. This option may be given more than once.
+.TP
+.B \-x\fR, \fB\-\-discard\-all
+Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.
+.TP
+.B \-X\fR, \fB\-\-discard\-locals
+Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols. (These usually start
+with "L" or ".").
+.TP
+.B \-b \fIbyte\fR, \fB\-\-byte=\fIbyte
+Keep only every \fIbyte\fPth byte of the input file (header data is
+not affected).  \fIbyte\fP can be in the range from 0 to the
+interleave-1.  This option is useful for creating files to program
+ROMs.  It is typically used with an srec output target.
+.TP
+.B \-i \fIinterleave\fR, \fB\-\-interleave=\fIinterleave
+Only copy one out of every \fIinterleave\fP bytes.  Which one to copy is
+selected by the \fB\-b\fP or \fB\-\-byte\fP option.  The default is 4.
+The interleave is ignored if neither \fB\-b\fP nor \fB\-\-byte\fP is given.
+.TP
+.B \-p\fR, \fB\-\-preserve\-dates
+Set the access and modification dates of the output file to be the same
+as those of the input file.
+.TP
+.B \-\-debugging
+Convert debugging information, if possible.  This is not the default
+because only certain debugging formats are supported, and the
+conversion process can be time consuming.
+.TP
+.B \-\-gap\-fill=\fIval
+Fill gaps between sections with \fIval\fP.  This operation applies to
+the \fIload address\fP (LMA) of the sections.  It is done by increasing
+the size of the section with the lower address, and filling in the extra
+space created with \fIval\fP.
+.TP
+.B \-\-pad\-to=\fIaddress
+Pad the output file up to the load address \fIaddress\fP.  This is
+done by increasing the size of the last section.  The extra space is
+filled in with the value specified by \fB\-\-gap\-fill\fP (default
+zero).
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-set\-start=\fIval
+Set the start address of the new file to \fIval\fP.  Not all object
+file formats support setting the start address.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-change\-start=\fIincr\fR, \fB\-\-adjust\-start=\fIincr
+Changes the start address by adding \fIincr\fP.  Not all object file
+formats support setting the start address.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-change\-addresses=\fIincr\fR, \fB\-\-adjust\-vma=\fIincr
+Changes the address of all sections, as well as the start address, by
+adding \fIincr\fP.  Some object file formats do not permit section
+addresses to be changed arbitrarily.  Note that this does not relocate
+the sections; if the program expects sections to be loaded at a
+certain address, and this option is used to change the sections such
+that they are loaded at a different address, the program may fail.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-change\-section\-address\ \fIsection{=,+,-}val\fR, \fB\-\-adjust\-section\-vma\ \fIsection{=,+,-}val
+Set or changes the VMA and LMA addresses of the named \fIsection\fP.
+If \fI=\fP is used, the section address is set to \fIval\fP.
+Otherwise, \fIval\fP is added to or subtracted from the section
+address.  See the comments under \fB\-\-change\-addresses\fP, above.  If
+\fIsection\fP does not exist in the input file, a warning will be
+issued, unless \fB\-\-no\-change\-warnings\fP is used.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-change\-section\-lma\ \fIsection{=,+,-}val
+Set or change the LMA address of the named \fIsection\fP.  If \fI=\fP is
+used, the section address is set to \fIval\fP.  Otherwise, \fIval\fP
+is added to or subtracted from the section address.  See the comments
+under \fB\-\-change\-addresses\fP, above.  If \fIsection\fP does not exist
+in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless
+\fB\-\-no\-change\-warnings\fP is used.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-change\-section\-vma\ \fIsection{=,+,-}val
+Set or change the VMA address of the named \fIsection\fP.  If \fI=\fP is
+used, the section address is set to \fIval\fP.  Otherwise, \fIval\fP
+is added to or subtracted from the section address.  See the comments
+under \fB\-\-change\-addresses\fP, above.  If \fIsection\fP does not exist
+in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless
+\fB\-\-no\-change\-warnings\fP is used.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-change\-warnings\fR, \fB\-\-adjust\-warnings
+If \fB\-\-change\-section\-XXX\fP is used, and the named section does
+not exist, issue a warning.  This is the default.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-no\-change\-warnings\fR, \fB\-\-no\-adjust\-warnings
+Do not issue a warning if \fB\-\-change\-section\-XXX\fP is used, even
+if the named section does not exist.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-set\-section\-flags\ \fIsection=flags
+Set the flags for the named section.  The \fIflags\fP argument is a
+comma separated string of flag names.  The recognized names are
+\fIalloc\fP, \fIcontents\fP, \fIload\fP, \fInoload\fP, \fIreadonly\fP,
+\fIcode\fP, \fIdata\fP, \fIrom\fP, \fIshare\fP, and \fIdebug\fP.  Not
+all flags are meaningful for all object file formats.
+.TP
+.B \fB\-\-add\-section\ \fIsectionname=filename
+Add a new section named \fIsectionname\fR while copying the file.  The
+contents of the new section are taken from the file \fIfilename\fR.
+The size of the section will be the size of the file.  This option
+only works on file formats which can support sections with arbitrary
+names.
+.TP
+.B \-\-change\-leading\-char
+Some object file formats use special characters at the start of
+symbols.  The most common such character is underscore, which compilers
+often add before every symbol.  This option tells 
+.B objcopy
+to change the leading character of every symbol when it converts
+between object file formats.  If the object file formats use the same
+leading character, this option has no effect.  Otherwise, it will add
+a character, or remove a character, or change a character, as
+appropriate.
+.TP
+.B \-\-remove\-leading\-char
+If the first character of a global symbol is a special symbol leading
+character used by the object file format, remove the character.  The
+most common symbol leading character is underscore.  This option will
+remove a leading underscore from all global symbols.  This can be
+useful if you want to link together objects of different file formats
+with different conventions for symbol names.  This is different from
+\fB\-\-change\-leading\-char\fP because it always changes the symbol name
+when appropriate, regardless of the object file format of the output
+.TP
+.B \-\-redefine\-sym\ \fIold=new
+Change the name of symbol \fIold\fR to \fInew\fR.  This can be useful
+when one is trying link two things together for which you have no
+source, and there are name collisions.
+.TP
+.B \-\-weaken
+Change all global symbols in the file to be weak.
+.TP
+.B \-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose
+Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of
+archives, "\fBobjcopy \-V\fR" lists all members of the archive.
+.TP
+.B \-V\fR, \fB\-\-version
+Show the version number of
+.B objcopy
+and exit.
+.TP
+.B \-\-help
+Show a summary of the options to
+.B objcopy
+and exit.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\c
+.B objdump\c
+\& displays information about one or more object files.
+The options control what particular information to display.  This
+information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
+compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their
+program to compile and work.
+.PP
+.IR  "objfile" .\|.\|.
+are the object files to be examined.  When you specify archives,
+\c
+.B objdump\c
+\& shows information on each of the member object files.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+Where long and short forms of an option are shown together, they are
+equivalent.  At least one option besides
+.B \-l
+(\fB\-\-line\-numbers\fP) must be given.
+
+.TP
+.B \-a
+.TP
+.B \-\-archive\-headers
+If any files from \c
+.I objfile\c
+\& are archives, display the archive
+header information (in a format similar to `\|\c
+.B ls \-l\c
+\|').  Besides the
+information you could list with `\|\c
+.B ar tv\c
+\|', `\|\c
+.B objdump \-a\c
+\|' shows
+the object file format of each archive member.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-adjust\-vma=" "offset"
+When dumping information, first add
+.I offset
+to all the section addresses.  This is useful if the section addresses
+do not correspond to the symbol table, which can happen when putting
+sections at particular addresses when using a format which can not
+represent section addresses, such as a.out.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-b " "bfdname"\c
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-target=" "bfdname"
+Specify the object-code format for the object files to be
+\c
+.I bfdname\c
+\&.  This may not be necessary; \c
+.I objdump\c
+\& can
+automatically recognize many formats.  For example,
+.sp
+.br
+objdump\ \-b\ oasys\ \-m\ vax\ \-h\ fu.o
+.br
+.sp
+display summary information from the section headers (`\|\c
+.B \-h\c
+\|') of
+`\|\c
+.B fu.o\c
+\|', which is explicitly identified (`\|\c
+.B \-m\c
+\|') as a Vax object
+file in the format produced by Oasys compilers.  You can list the
+formats available with the `\|\c
+.B \-i\c
+\|' option.
+
+.TP
+.B \-C
+.TP
+.B \-\-demangle
+Decode (\fIdemangle\fP) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
+Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
+makes C++ function names readable.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-debugging
+Display debugging information.  This attempts to parse debugging
+information stored in the file and print it out using a C like syntax.
+Only certain types of debugging information have been implemented.
+
+.TP
+.B \-d
+.TP
+.B \-\-disassemble
+Display the assembler mnemonics for the machine
+instructions from \c
+.I objfile\c
+\&.
+This option only disassembles those sections which are
+expected to contain instructions.
+
+.TP
+.B \-D
+.TP
+.B \-\-disassemble-all
+Like \fB\-d\fP, but disassemble the contents of all sections, not just
+those expected to contain instructions.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-prefix\-addresses
+When disassembling, print the complete address on each line.  This is
+the older disassembly format.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-disassemble\-zeroes
+Normally the disassembly output will skip blocks of zeroes.  This
+option directs the disassembler to disassemble those blocks, just like
+any other data.
+
+.TP
+.B \-EB
+.TP
+.B \-EL
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-endian=" "{big|little}"
+Specify the endianness of the object files.  This only affects
+disassembly.  This can be useful when disassembling a file format which
+does not describe endianness information, such as S-records.
+
+.TP
+.B \-f
+.TP
+.B \-\-file\-headers
+Display summary information from the overall header of
+each file in \c
+.I objfile\c
+\&.
+
+.TP
+.B \-h
+.TP
+.B \-\-section\-headers
+.TP
+.B \-\-headers
+Display summary information from the section headers of the
+object file.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-help
+Print a summary of the options to
+.B objdump
+and exit.
+
+.TP
+.B \-i
+.TP
+.B \-\-info
+Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available
+for specification with \c
+.B \-b\c
+\& or \c
+.B \-m\c
+\&.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-j " "name"\c
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-section=" "name"
+Display information only for section \c
+.I name\c
+\&.
+
+.TP
+.B \-l
+.TP
+.B \-\-line\-numbers
+Label the display (using debugging information) with the filename
+and source line numbers corresponding to the object code shown.
+Only useful with \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-D\fP, or \fB\-r\fP.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-m " "machine"\c
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-architecture=" "machine"
+Specify the architecture to use when disassembling object files.  This
+can be useful when disassembling object files which do not describe
+architecture information, such as S-records.  You can list the available
+architectures with the \fB\-i\fP option. 
+
+.TP
+.B \-p
+.TP
+.B \-\-private\-headers
+Print information that is specific to the object file format.  The
+exact information printed depends upon the object file format.  For
+some object file formats, no additional information is printed.
+
+.TP
+.B \-r
+.TP
+.B \-\-reloc
+Print the relocation entries of the file.  If used with \fB\-d\fP or
+\fB\-D\fP, the relocations are printed interspersed with the
+disassembly.
+
+.TP
+.B \-R
+.TP
+.B \-\-dynamic\-reloc
+Print the dynamic relocation entries of the file.  This is only
+meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
+libraries.
+
+.TP
+.B \-s
+.TP
+.B \-\-full\-contents
+Display the full contents of any sections requested.
+
+.TP
+.B \-S
+.TP
+.B \-\-source
+Display source code intermixed with disassembly, if possible.  Implies
+\fB-d\fP.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-show\-raw\-insn
+When disassembling instructions, print the instruction in hex as well as
+in symbolic form.  This is the default except when
+.B \-\-prefix\-addresses
+is used.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-no\-show\-raw\-insn
+When disassembling instructions, do not print the instruction bytes.
+This is the default when
+.B \-\-prefix\-addresses
+is used.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-stabs
+Display the contents of the .stab, .stab.index, and .stab.excl
+sections from an ELF file.  This is only useful on systems (such as
+Solaris 2.0) in which .stab debugging symbol-table entries are carried
+in an ELF section.  In most other file formats, debugging symbol-table
+entries are interleaved with linkage symbols, and are visible in the
+.B \-\-syms
+output.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-start\-address=" "address"
+Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output
+of the
+.B \-d\c
+,
+.B \-r
+and
+.B \-s
+options.
+
+.TP
+.BI "\-\-stop\-address=" "address"
+Stop displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output
+of the
+.B \-d\c
+,
+.B \-r
+and
+.B \-s
+options.
+
+.TP
+.B \-t
+.TP
+.B \-\-syms
+Symbol Table.  Print the symbol table entries of the file.
+This is similar to the information provided by the `\|\c
+.B nm\c
+\|' program.
+
+.TP
+.B \-T
+.TP
+.B \-\-dynamic\-syms
+Dynamic Symbol Table.  Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the
+file.  This is only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain
+types of shared libraries.  This is similar to the information
+provided by the `\|\c
+.B nm\c
+\|' program when given the
+.B \-D (\-\-dynamic)
+option.
+
+.TP
+.B \-\-version
+Print the version number of
+.B objdump
+and exit.
+
+.TP
+.B \-x
+.TP
+.B \-\-all\-headers
+Display all available header information, including the symbol table and
+relocation entries.  Using `\|\c
+.B \-x\c
+\|' is equivalent to specifying all of
+`\|\c
+.B \-a \-f \-h \-r \-t\c
